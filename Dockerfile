# Stage 0 — the uv build tool, pinned by digest.
#
# This used to be `COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /uvx /bin/`, with
# a comment arguing a floating tag was fine because uv is the installer rather
# than a project dependency. Two things were wrong with that.
#
#   * `:latest` is re-resolved on EVERY build, so two builds of this commit can
#     install two different binaries and nothing here records which one shipped.
#     Every other input to this image is pinned — the interpreter by
#     .python-version, the dependency set by uv.lock under `uv sync --frozen`,
#     the ephemeris data to sha256 by ci/swiss_ephemeris.json. The tool that
#     performs the frozen install was the one input still resolved at build time.
#
#   * `COPY --from=<registry image>` is invisible to the automated dependency
#     updater. .github/dependabot.yml already watches the `docker` ecosystem for
#     this directory, but that ecosystem reads FROM instructions; an image named
#     only in a COPY is never parsed, so it is neither bumped for a disclosed CVE
#     nor reported as outdated. Pinning a digest on the COPY would have swapped a
#     mutable reference for a frozen one that nothing was watching.
#
# Declaring it as a stage fixes both: the reference is now a FROM the updater can
# see and version-bump, and it carries an immutable digest between bumps. The
# `:<version>@sha256:<digest>` form is deliberate — the digest is what makes the
# build reproducible, the tag is what the updater compares to decide a newer
# release exists and what makes a bump legible in a diff.
#
# Digest resolved 2026-08-16 and cross-checked against three sources, which all
# returned the same index digest:
#   docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.12.5
#   the GHCR registry API's Docker-Content-Digest header for that tag
#   docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.12.5
# It is the multi-arch INDEX digest, so it resolves on every build platform, and
# `:latest` resolved to the identical index at that moment — this pin changes no
# bytes today, it stops them moving unrecorded tomorrow.
#
# ci/tests/test_dockerfile_image_pins.py is the guard on this shape.

# Stage 1 — the Swiss ephemeris data files.
#
# These are BAKED INTO the image, not supplied at runtime. They used to be
# neither: this file created an empty data/ephe and a comment claimed the data
# "must be volume-mounted or COPY'd separately", but no mount was ever codified
# anywhere. swisseph does not raise when its data files are missing — it
# silently substitutes its built-in Moshier analytical ephemeris and returns a
# plausible result — so a deployment computed every chart it served on the
# fallback engine and looked perfectly healthy doing it.
#
# Baking rather than mounting, deliberately:
#   * ~2.1 MB is nothing against a container image;
#   * the data becomes immutable WITH THE IMAGE DIGEST, so rolling back to an
#     image is rolling back to its data — which matters because this service is
#     deployed by resolved digest;
#   * it removes the whole class of "deployed without its data" rather than
#     adding one more runtime dependency that can silently be absent;
#   * and EVERY builder of this Dockerfile gets the data — CI, a downstream
#     deploy pipeline, a local `docker build`, a compose stack — instead of each
#     one having to remember a fetch step of its own. That "every caller must
#     remember" shape is exactly what failed here.
#
# The fetch reuses the repo's existing checksum-pinned fetcher against
# ci/swiss_ephemeris.json; there is deliberately no second mechanism. It is
# fail-closed in every direction (download failure, checksum mismatch, unpinned
# checksum, malformed manifest all exit non-zero). --self-test runs FIRST so a
# verifier that had stopped verifying can never certify the real download, and
# --verify-only re-checks afterwards, so what stage 2 copies forward is bytes
# that were checksummed after they landed.

# A successful COPY proves files were copied. It does NOT prove the engine uses
# them: a request that asks for FLG_SWIEPH with the data absent, unreadable, or
# at the wrong path still SUCCEEDS and returns a plausible position with
# FLG_MOSEPH set. Never infer "Swiss is active" from a call that did not raise
# — read the retflag bit, which is what probe_ephemeris_source() does.
#
# Placed AFTER `USER appuser`, deliberately, and this is not a detail. An
# earlier draft of this file ran the same assertion as root, above. It PASSED,
# the image contained all four data files — and `docker run` as appuser still
# reported retflag 65604, because the fetcher's tempfile left the files 0600
# and root could read what appuser could not. A control verified as a different
# principal than the one that runs in production is not verified. (The root
# cause is fixed in ci/fetch_swiss_ephemeris.py, which now chmods 0644; this
# placement is what would have caught it, and what catches the next one.)
#
# Both bodies are checked because the data set is split across files:
# sepl_18.se1 carries the planets and semo_18.se1 the Moon, so a Sun-only
# assertion passes on a data set that leaves every nakshatra, pada and dasha
# on the fallback. Failing HERE makes an image that computes on the fallback
# impossible to produce, rather than merely unlikely.
