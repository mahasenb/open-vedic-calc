# The lunar node model (Rahu / Ketu) is DECLARED here. It is never inherited.
#
# Rahu and Ketu can be computed from either the TRUE (osculating) lunar node --
# the actual instantaneous intersection of the Moon's orbital plane with the
# ecliptic -- or the MEAN node, a smoothed analytical fit to that intersection.
# Measured with the pinned dependency set (pyswisseph 2.10.3.2, pyjhora 4.8.6)
# against the real Swiss ephemeris data files, over the engine's supported
# birth-date span (1800-01-01..2400-12-31, app/schemas.py) at one-day steps and
# refined at one-hour steps around the worst day:
#
#     max |true - mean| = 1.981465100 deg = 118.8879 arcmin = 7133.2744 arcsec
#                         at 1905-10-10 22:00 UT
#
# and across those 219511 sampled days the two models put Rahu in a different
# nakshatra PADA on 28.85% of them, a different NAKSHATRA on 7.19%, and a
# different RASI on 3.20%. Ketu follows Rahu exactly (Rahu + 180 deg), so the
# choice moves both shadow grahas together. For scale, that is more than twice
# the ~0.883 deg Lahiri-vs-Fagan/Bradley ayanamsa error documented above.
#
# WHY TRUE. Every other graha this engine serves is a true/apparent position
# from a modern ephemeris; the true node is the same class of quantity, so
# serving a smoothed mean element for one graha alone would make a single chart
# internally inconsistent. The Siddhantic mean-motion treatment of Rahu is a
# computational method of its era, not a doctrinal requirement, and this engine
# already declines that era's methods for every visible graha. It is also what
# the engine already served, so declaring it moves no number that any caller has
# already been given.
#
# WHY IT IS DECLARED AT ALL, given it matches the library's current behaviour:
# an inherited default is not a choice, it is an accident that happens to be
# right. A library release that moved it would have moved every Rahu and Ketu by
# up to 1.98 deg with no change in this repository at all. The committed goldens
# would have failed -- but a golden failure with no declared model anywhere reads
# as a regression to chase rather than a deliberate choice to honour. The
# dependency is additionally pinned to an exact version in pyproject.toml so the
# default cannot move underneath this declaration in the first place; this block
# is what makes the choice legible when it does move.
#
# THREE INDEPENDENT LEVERS, and the third is the one that actually serves.
# Verified by measurement, not by reading the config (flip only the first and the
# served chart does not move at all):
#
#   1. ``const._RAHU`` / ``const._use_true_nodes_for_rahu_ketu`` -- read at call
#      time by every ``drik.sidereal_longitude(jd, const._RAHU)`` site.
#   2. ``drik.planet_list`` -- a MUTABLE module global, rebuilt by
#      ``drik.set_planet_list()``; body id -> planet id for the position loops.
#   3. ``drik.dhasavarga``'s own parameter default. This is the lever the chart
#      path uses: ``charts.rasi_chart`` -> ``drik.dhasavarga(jd, place, 1)``,
#      and dhasavarga declares ``set_rahu_ketu_as_true_nodes=True`` as a LITERAL
#      default (not ``None``), so it re-derives planet_list from that literal and
#      never consults lever 1 at all. Setting only the constants therefore leaves
#      every served Rahu unchanged -- a declaration that looked applied and was
#      not. ``apply_lunar_node_model`` below pins 1 and 2 and VERIFIES 3.
#
# Because lever 3 is a library literal this repo cannot set, declaring
# LUNAR_NODE_MODEL = "mean" hard-fails at import rather than silently serving
# true-node charts under a mean-node banner. That is deliberate: switching model
# is real work (routing the chart path through
# ``drik.dhasavarga(..., set_rahu_ketu_as_true_nodes=False)`` instead of
# ``charts.rasi_chart``) plus a deliberate re-recording of the Swiss goldens, and
# a one-word edit here must not be able to look like it did that work.
#
# Changing LUNAR_NODE_MODEL is an astrological model decision, not an
# implementation detail: it invalidates every previously served chart.
# tests/test_lunar_node_model.py is the tripwire that enforces all of the above.

    Pins the two levers this repo can set, and verifies the third it cannot:

    1. ``const.set_node_mode`` rather than assigning ``const._RAHU`` directly,

       sites read ``const._RAHU``, while ``set_planet_list`` and others read the
       boolean ``_use_true_nodes_for_rahu_ketu``. A direct assignment would
       desynchronise them and leave different limbs of one chart describing
       different nodes.
    2. ``drik.set_planet_list``, because ``drik.planet_list`` is a mutable
       module global that was built from the constants at drik's own import

    ``const._KETU`` is deliberately NOT verified: the library resolves it to -10
    under the true node and to ``-swe.MEAN_NODE`` -- which is also -10 -- under
    the mean node, so it carries no information about which model is active. It
    is a sentinel that makes the library compute Ketu as Rahu + 180 deg, which

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The swisseph POSITION-FLAG WORD is DECLARED here. It is never inherited.
#
# Every planetary longitude this engine serves is the result of
# ``swe.calc_ut(jd, body, flags)``. That third argument decides the REFERENCE
# FRAME the number is expressed in -- geometric or apparent, with or without
# gravitational deflection, with or without nutation, sidereal or tropical. It is
# part of what the answer means, not a tuning knob.
#
# It used to be inherited from ``drik.PLANET_FLAGS``, which the astronomy library
# builds at ITS import time from ``jhora.const.PLANET_POSITIONS_*`` module
# globals. Measured 2026-07-31, this same repository on two dependency resolves:
#
#     frozen resolve (pyjhora 4.8.6, pyswisseph 2.10.3.2)  PLANET_FLAGS = 66386
#     one patch release later (pyjhora 4.8.7)              PLANET_FLAGS = 65810
#
# a difference of 576 = FLG_NOGDEFL (512) | FLG_NONUT (64), because 4.8.7 flipped
# ``PLANET_POSITIONS_USE_DEFLECTION`` and ``PLANET_POSITIONS_USE_NUTATION`` from
# False to True. No file here changed, and nothing in this repository went red.
#
# WHAT THE GOVERNING FLAGS ARE WORTH. Measured with the frozen resolve against
# the real Swiss ephemeris data files, scanning 1800-01-01..2400-12-31 (the
# supported birth-date span, app/schemas.py) at one-day steps -- 219511 days x 9
# grahas:
#
#   FLG_TRUEPOS (geometric vs apparent)
#       max 0.016817256 deg = 60.5421 arcsec, Mercury at 2353-06-16 00:00 UT.
#       Per graha: Mercury 60.5421", Venus 44.7711", Mars 38.9693",
#       Jupiter 30.0595", Saturn 27.2519", Sun 20.8489", Moon 0.7632",
#       Rahu/Ketu 0.0146".
#
#   FLG_NOGDEFL + FLG_NONUT (the 576 that moved between the two resolves)
#       max 0.000000000 deg = 0.000000 arcsec, every graha, all 219511 days.
#
# The second number is why this block exists. Under FLG_TRUEPOS swisseph ignores
# deflection and aberration outright, and for a sidereal request it applies
# FLG_NONUT of its own accord (a request of FLG_SWIEPH|FLG_SIDEREAL comes back
# with retflag 65602, carrying an FLG_NONUT nobody asked for). So the library's
# flag word moved and NO golden in this repository could have caught it -- the
# served numbers were bit-identical. The 576 is inert, but inert CONDITIONALLY,
# masked by another flag inherited from the same undeclared source: clear
# FLG_TRUEPOS and FLG_NOGDEFL is worth 0.0711 arcsec and FLG_NOABERR 20.8557
# arcsec (measured at century steps over the same span). Three coupled defaults,
# one of which decides whether the other two matter, is not a frame anyone chose.
#
# WHY THIS FRAME. It is the frame the engine already served, so declaring it
# moves no number any caller has been given -- deliberately, exactly as with the
# lunar node model above. FLG_TRUEPOS (geometric, i.e. light-time and aberration
# not applied) is the classical Vedic convention: BPHS positions are the graha's
# true place on the ecliptic, and the ~60 arcsec of light-time and aberration
# that separate it from the apparent place are an observational correction with
# no BPHS meaning. Every limb of a chart -- nakshatra, pada, varga, dasha balance
# -- is then derived from one consistent frame. FLG_SIDEREAL with the Lahiri
# ayanamsa follows from the engine being sidereal at all; FLG_SPEED is required
# because ``drik.planets_in_retrograde`` reads the sign of the returned daily
# motion; FLG_NOGDEFL and FLG_NONUT are inert under FLG_TRUEPOS today and are
# declared so that they cannot become live silently. FLG_TOPOCTR is deliberately
# NOT taken: this service receives no observer altitude, and a topocentric frame
# would make every position depend on one.
#
# THREE LEVERS, measured rather than read from documentation:
#
#   1. ``jhora.const.PLANET_POSITIONS_*`` -- five module globals, read by
#      ``jhora.utils.set_flags_for_planet_positions()`` on every call. This is
#      the INHERITED DEFAULT, and it is what moved between 4.8.6 and 4.8.7.
#   2. ``drik.PLANET_FLAGS`` -- a MUTABLE module global built from (1) at drik's
#      import time, i.e. before anything in this package has run. This is the
#      word that actually SERVES: ``drik.sidereal_longitude``, ``drik.dhasavarga``
#      (hence ``charts.rasi_chart``) and ``drik.planets_in_retrograde`` all read
#      it at call time.
#   3. ``jhora.const._TROPICAL_MODE`` -- when true, ``drik.sidereal_longitude``
#      ignores ``PLANET_FLAGS`` entirely and computes with
#      ``FLG_SWIEPH + FLG_SPEED``, i.e. tropical, ~24 deg away. A pinned word
#      that is bypassed is not a pin.
#
# ``apply_position_flags`` below compares (1) against this declaration and
# refuses to start on any disagreement, PINS (2) and reads it back, and verifies
# (3). The comparison against (1) is the dependency-bump tripwire: pinning alone
# would silently absorb a library that changed its mind, which is the failure
# this block exists to end.
#
# SCOPE, stated rather than left to be discovered. This is the PLANETARY POSITION
# word only. The ascendant and Bhava-Chalit cusps come from
# ``swe.houses(jd_utc, lat, lon, b"P")`` in chart.py, which takes no flag word at
# all; sunrise/sunset use pyjhora's separate ``drik.RISE_FLAGS`` /
# ``drik.SET_FLAGS`` (measured 897 / 898, identical in 4.8.6 and 4.8.7, so they
# have not moved -- but they are equally undeclared).
#
# Contract: tests/test_position_flags.py. Extend it, never weaken it. The
# dependency that supplies all three levers is pinned to an exact version in
# pyproject.toml for the same reason the lunar node model needs it to be.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The sunrise/sunset CONVENTION word is DECLARED here. It is never inherited.
#
# Every electional and panchanga limb this engine serves is anchored to the day
# boundary: ``drik.sunrise``/``drik.sunset``/``drik.moonrise``/``drik.moonset``,
# and through them the tithi, nakshatra, yoga, karana, the thirty muhurtas, the
# raahu/yamaganda/gulika windows and the whole muhurat/lagna-shuddhi scan. Each
# of those rise/set calls passes a second bit word to swisseph's
# ``swe.rise_trans`` -- the ``rsmi`` argument, DISTINCT from the ephemeris flag
# word POSITION_FLAGS pins. The ``rsmi`` word decides WHAT COUNTS AS SUNRISE:
# whether the Sun's disc centre or its lower limb touches the horizon, whether
# that horizon is the true (geometric) one or the apparent (refracted) one, and
# whether the rise or the set instant is wanted. It is not a tuning knob; it is
# part of what "sunrise" means, and a day whose start moves drags every limb
# measured from it.
#
# Until this block existed the engine stated that word nowhere. It inherited
# ``drik.RISE_FLAGS`` / ``drik.SET_FLAGS``, which the astronomy library builds at
# ITS import time from ``jhora.utils.set_flags_for_rise_set()``, which in turn
# reads three ``jhora.const.RISE_SET_*`` module globals. Measured with the frozen
# resolve (pyjhora 4.8.6, pyswisseph 2.10.3.2): RISE_FLAGS = 897, SET_FLAGS = 898,
# identical in 4.8.6 and 4.8.7 -- so unlike the position-flag word (which moved
# 66386 -> 65810 on that same bump) this one has not moved. But "has not moved"
# is not "declared": the same three ``const`` globals that build it are exactly
# the shape of default that pyjhora 4.8.7 flipped for the position word, and a
# release that flips ``RISE_SET_USE_REFRACTION`` or
# ``RISE_SET_USE_DISC_CENTER_FOR_RISING`` would move every served sunrise with no
# change in this repository and nothing here to notice it.
#
# THE CONVENTION THIS ENGINE DECLARES: swisseph's BIT_HINDU_RISING (896), which
# is the composite the Vedic (BPHS / Surya-Siddhanta) tradition wants -- the Sun's
# disc CENTRE at the TRUE, unrefracted horizon (geocentric, no ecliptic-latitude
# correction). This is the "madhya-bimba" sunrise of the classical panchanga, and
# it is what ``drik.sunrise``'s own docstring states ("centre of disc at horizon")
# and what the drik source comments call "geometric, i.e. true sunrise/set, so
# refraction is not considered". It is a deliberate choice, NOT the only defensible
# one: the civil/almanac convention (upper limb at the refracted horizon) is what
# a secular ephemeris reports, and some panchanga makers use it. This engine takes
# the geometric disc-centre convention because it is the one the Siddhantic tithi
# arithmetic assumes; changing it is an astronomical decision that moves every
# served day boundary, not an implementation detail.
#
# TWO LEVERS, not three -- there is no runtime bypass here analogous to the
# position word's ``_TROPICAL_MODE``. Measured, not read from documentation:
#
#   1. ``jhora.const.RISE_SET_HINDU_RISING`` / ``_USE_REFRACTION`` /
#      ``_USE_DISC_CENTER_FOR_RISING`` -- three module globals read by
#      ``jhora.utils.set_flags_for_rise_set()`` every time it is called. This is
#      the INHERITED DEFAULT. Measured, flipping each one moves the word to a
#      distinct value: hindu-rising off -> 769/770, refraction on -> 385/386,
#      disc-bottom -> 9089/9090.
#   2. ``drik.RISE_FLAGS`` / ``drik.SET_FLAGS`` -- two MUTABLE module globals,
#      built from (1) at drik's import time (before anything in this package has
#      run), read at call time by ``drik.sunrise`` (``rsmi=RISE_FLAGS``),
#      ``drik.sunset`` (``rsmi=SET_FLAGS``) and the two lunar equivalents.
#
# ``apply_rise_set_flags`` below compares (1) against this declaration and refuses
# to start on any disagreement -- the dependency-bump tripwire, exactly as
# ``apply_position_flags`` does for the position word -- then pins (2) and reads
# both back. It is called at import, after the position word, and
# ``bphs_core/__init__.py`` imports utils first, so the pins land before any
# sibling module uses drik.
#
# SCOPE, stated so it is not discovered later. This is the sunrise/sunset ``rsmi``
# convention word only. The ephemeris frame the same ``rise_trans`` call uses for
# the Sun's position (its ``flags`` argument) is ``drik.PLANET_FLAGS``, already
# pinned by ``apply_position_flags`` above. drik's unrelated module global
# ``_rise_flags`` (an ephemeris word, ``BIT_HINDU_RISING | FLG_TRUEPOS |
# FLG_SPEED``) is NOT on the served sunrise/sunset path -- those functions take
# ``rsmi=RISE_FLAGS``/``SET_FLAGS`` and ``flags=PLANET_FLAGS`` -- and is left out
# of this declaration deliberately.
#
# Contract: tests/test_rise_set_flags.py. Extend it, never weaken it. The
# dependency is pinned to an exact version in pyproject.toml for the same reason
# the position word needs it to be.

# only the importing thread. Every other thread starts with:
#
#   * no ephemeris path -> swe_calc silently falls back to the built-in Moshier

#     with SEFLG_MOSEPH set in retflag instead of SEFLG_SWIEPH.
#   * no sidereal mode  -> swisseph's default Fagan/Bradley ayanamsa, which
#     differs from Lahiri by ~0.88 degrees (53 arcmin) — enough to move a
#     nakshatra pada, and a sign near a boundary.
#
# That matters because this service does nearly all of its computing on
# non-importing threads: Starlette's threadpool for the synchronous ``def``
# ``/v1/*`` handlers, and the background scan-job pool in ``app/jobs.py``. The
# mounted Swiss ephemeris data was being bypassed on exactly the paths that
# serve real requests, while ``/healthz``'s ``ephe_loaded`` — a directory
# existence check — reported fine. (Now fixed: ``/healthz`` calls
# ``probe_ephemeris_source()`` below, the same retflag-based detector as the
# accuracy gate, instead of checking whether the directory exists.)

# thread pools can enter it concurrently in one process: Starlette's
# per-request pool for the synchronous ``def`` route handlers, and the

# engine.
#
# serialized_ephemeris also calls _ensure_thread_ephemeris_state() on EVERY
# invocation, not just once: a thread pool reuses worker threads across

# "submissions never wait on scan compute" property (see CLAUDE.md). It is
# an RLock so nested entry points — e.g. a per-instant scorer that builds
# a Chart — re-acquire it on the same thread without deadlock. The

# BPHS reads Rahu and Ketu as permanently retrograde (vakri) -- they are the

# serves them that way as a stated astrological decision.
#
# What was actually being served before this declaration existed, measured
# 2026-08-07 on the frozen resolve (pyjhora 4.8.6, pyswisseph 2.10.3.2):
# retrogression reaches a chart through ``drik.planets_in_retrograde``, and
# that function excludes BOTH nodes from its loop unconditionally --
#
#     _planet_list = {p: p_id for p, p_id in planet_list.items()
#                     if p not in [const._RAHU, const._KETU]}
#
# -- so it can never name them, and chart.py's ``pid in retro_planets`` was
# False for Rahu and Ketu on every date. Over 1461 charts (2000-01-01 ..
# 2019-12-27, 5-day steps) both shadow grahas came back retrograde on 0, while
# the same sweep saw Saturn retrograde on 35.93% and Mercury on 19.16% -- the
# sweep could observe retrogression and simply never saw it here. The engine
# was reporting both shadow grahas as permanently DIRECT: the exact inverse of
# the classical reading, on every chart it had ever served.
#
# That zero is structural, not a sampling artefact and not an
# ephemeris-runtime artefact: it reproduces identically against the real Swiss
# data files and against the built-in Moshier fallback.
#
# Why this is DECLARED rather than derived from the ephemeris, which is the
# obvious-looking alternative: under the declared TRUE (osculating) node the
# astronomical speed sign is not constant. Measured against the real Swiss
# data over 350400 hourly samples (1990-01-01 .. +40y), the true node's
# longitude speed is positive -- direct -- on 25.82% of them, peaking at
# +0.128202129 deg/day at 2029-06-21 00:00 UT, while the mean node is

#   * pyjhora's planet indices — the order of PLANETS above (Sun 0, Moon 1,
#     Mars 2, Mercury 3, Jupiter 4, Venus 5, Saturn 6, Rahu 7, Ketu 8). This
#     is the space pyjhora's chart OUTPUTS use (``charts.rasi_chart``,
#     ``drik.dhasavarga``, ``drik.planets_in_retrograde`` return these).
#   * swisseph body ids — what ``swe.calc_ut`` and ``drik.sidereal_longitude``
#     CONSUME (Sun 0, Moon 1, Mercury 2, Venus 3, Mars 4, Jupiter 5, Saturn 6,
#     Uranus 7, Neptune 8, the lunar node 10/11). pyjhora's own docstring on
#     ``sidereal_longitude`` is explicit: "The sequence number of 0 to 8 for
#     planets is not followed by swiss ephemeris".
#
# Sun, Moon and Saturn share the same value in both spaces, which is what
# makes the conflation survivable: a spot check of those three looks right
# while every other graha silently becomes a DIFFERENT CELESTIAL BODY —
# index 2 ("Mars") computes Mercury, 3 ("Mercury") computes Venus, 4
# ("Jupiter") computes Mars, 5 ("Venus") computes Jupiter, 7 ("Rahu")
# computes Uranus and 8 ("Ketu") computes Neptune. Measured with the pinned
# dependency set at 2026-07-31 00:00 UT: index 7 returned 40.7495 deg
# (Uranus) where the true node stood at 305.5916 deg.
#
# The rule this boundary enforces: raw integer body ids never cross a module
# edge. ``graha_sidereal_longitude`` below is the ONLY sanctioned route from
# a graha to ``drik.sidereal_longitude``, and it is keyed by graha NAME — a
# key that exists in neither integer space, so neither kind of int can be
# passed to it at all (either raises KeyError immediately). The table is
# written out longhand from explicit ``swe.*`` constants; never rebuild it
# from ``enumerate(PLANETS)``. tests/test_graha_body_ids.py enforces both
# halves: the served longitudes are asserted per-graha against independent
# computations, and an AST scan fails any new ``sidereal_longitude`` /
