"""Regression guard: CI keeps actually running the suite against real Swiss data (CALC-1).

``tests/test_swiss_ephemeris.py`` SKIPS when no ephemeris data files are present —
deliberately, because the fast ``test`` job and the default local loop genuinely have
none. That skip is only safe because one CI job does supply the data and sets
``REQUIRE_SWISS_EPHEMERIS=1``, which converts the skip into a hard failure.

Delete that job, drop its fetch step, or lose that env var, and the accuracy tests
quietly become three permanent skips while the workflow still looks like it covers
them. That is the fail-open shape this file exists to prevent — the same class of
defect as the "docker-test-image only BUILDS the test image, it never runs the suite
against real data" gap that made CALC-1 look closed when it was not.

WHY A PARSER, NOT A LINE-SCAN
-----------------------------
``grep REQUIRE_SWISS_EPHEMERIS .github/workflows/test.yml`` matches the string in a
comment, in a commented-out step, in another job's ``run:`` body, or in this very
file's name — none of which means the job sets it. PyYAML resolves the workflow to a
data structure in which a comment cannot exist, so every assertion below is about
structure: a job exists, its steps include one whose ``run`` invokes the fetcher, and
its pytest step's ``env`` mapping carries the flag. ``test_parser_discriminates``
feeds that logic the fixtures a textual scanner gets wrong, and the real assertions
re-invoke it so an unproven parser can never certify the workflow green.

STRUCTURAL BACKSTOP (round 4). Three rounds of review each found a NEW way to
silently disable the job/workflow that the semantic checks above did not
model. Reimplementing GitHub Actions' full `if:`/trigger-filter semantics is
an unbounded surface, so this file also carries a snapshot assertion (see
the module-level comment above ``test_swiss_job_enablement_snapshot_matches_committed_shape``,
near the end of this file) over the raw enablement-relevant shape of the
workflow. The semantic checks are the diagnostics -- they give a precise
reason a specific `if:`/filter form is wrong; the snapshot is the backstop --
it catches any change to that shape, known or not, without evaluating
anything. Keep both; neither is redundant with the other.

    `github.event_name` (substituted with the event name under test). Anything
    else — a function call, a different context, a matrix reference — raises
    _UnsupportedExpression rather than guessing a truth value.

    OPERATOR PRECEDENCE (round 3, finding 1a). GitHub Actions' documented order
    of evaluation, highest-binding first, is:

        1. ()                  grouping
        2. !                   logical NOT (unary)

        5. &&                  logical AND
        6. ||                  logical OR

    So `!` binds to the single operand right after it, TIGHTER than `==`/`!=`:
    `!github.event_name == 'schedule'` is `(!github.event_name) == 'schedule'`,
    NOT `!(github.event_name == 'schedule')`. A round-1/round-2 version of this
    evaluator applied `!` above comparison (between `_and_expr` and comparison),
    which silently inverted every un-parenthesized `!x == y` condition — see
    the mutation fixtures in `test_enablement_parser_discriminates` for the
    concrete case this broke. The grammar below encodes the table above
    directly: `_or_expr` wraps `_and_expr` wraps `_comparison` wraps `_unary`
    wraps `_primary`, so `!` (in `_unary`) sits strictly BELOW `==`/`!=` (in
    `_comparison`) and can only ever bind to the primary right next to it.

    PAREN GROUPING MUST NOT CHANGE A VALUE'S TYPE (round 4, finding 2). GitHub
    Actions parens are pure grouping. A round-2/round-3 version of `_primary`'s
    paren branch returned `self._or_expr()`, which funnelled through
    `_comparison`'s bare-operand fallback -- and that fallback used to return
    `bool(lhs)` unconditionally, so `(github.event_name)` became the Python
    bool `True` instead of the string `'push'`. Any later comparison against
    that parenthesised value then compared against an already-mangled type
    and guessed wrong in both directions: `(github.event_name) == true`
    reported the job enabled (comparing `True == True`) when GHA's own
    type-coercion table (string -> NaN, boolean -> 1/0, NaN never equal to
    anything) makes it `false` for every event; `(github.event_name) ==
    'push'` reported disabled (comparing `True == 'push'`) when a real push
    event makes it `true`. `_comparison` below now returns its bare operand
    completely unchanged when no `==`/`!=` follows, so a parenthesised value
    keeps its real type all the way up; `bool()` is applied only where GHA
    itself requires a boolean -- combining two operands with `&&`/`||`, `!`'s
    negation, and the final result of `parse()`.

#
# and it silently drops tests/test_independent_reference_corpus.py (the NASA/JPL

# are gated on the `swiss_ephemeris` fixture, so in the fast `test` job — which has no
# ephemeris data — they SKIP. Narrow the target here and they skip in BOTH jobs: the
# external-authority accuracy assertions stop running anywhere, green, silently. That
# is the same fail-open shape as deleting the job, reached by editing one path.

#
# Every check above reads the suite step's `run:` body. pytest takes arguments
# from two other places that a reader of that line cannot see:
#
#   1. `PYTEST_ADDOPTS` in the environment. GitHub Actions resolves `env:` at
#      three levels — workflow, job, step — and any of them reaches the pytest
#      process. `PYTEST_ADDOPTS: "-k nothing"` next to REQUIRE_SWISS_EPHEMERIS
#      leaves the run line reading `pytest tests/ -q`, every existing guard green,
#      and zero tests executed.
#   2. `addopts` in pytest's own config. This repo configures pytest in
#      pyproject.toml; `addopts = "-k not_corpus"` there narrows every pytest
#      invocation in the repo, including the accuracy job's, with no workflow
#      change at all.
#
# This is the deliberate-evasion class rather than the accidental-edit class the
# run-line checks target, which is exactly why it is worth closing: an accidental
# narrowing is at least visible in the diff of the line that runs the suite.
#
# PARSED, NOT GREPPED, on both arms — for the same reason the rest of this file
# parses: `# PYTEST_ADDOPTS: "-k nothing"` in a comment, or the string inside an
# `echo`, must not be mistaken for the real thing.
