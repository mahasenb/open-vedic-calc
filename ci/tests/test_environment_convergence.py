"""Regression guard: ONE dependency resolve, validated where it ships.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
This repository resolved its dependencies in more than one way at once, and the
resolve the test suite validated was not the resolve that shipped. Measured on
2026-08-05, four distinct installed sets existed simultaneously:

  * the ``test`` jobs in ``test.yml`` and ``publish.yml`` installed with a
    floating ``pip install -e ".[dev]"`` — which ignores ``uv.lock`` entirely
    and resolves whatever is newest at the moment the job runs;
  * the ``swiss-ephemeris`` job and ``Dockerfile.test`` installed
    ``uv sync --frozen --extra dev``;
  * the shipped ``Dockerfile`` installs ``uv sync --frozen --no-dev``;
  * a developer checkout's ``.venv`` was a fourth resolve again, on a
    different interpreter entirely.

The floating set differed from the shipped set on **13 packages that ship**
(fastapi 0.141.1 vs 0.136.3, uvicorn 0.52.1 vs 0.48.0, anyio, certifi, cffi,
charset-normalizer, click, idna, pytz, typing-extensions, websockets,
annotated-types, annotated-doc). So the suite that gates every merge was
certifying a dependency set no deployment ever ran.

THE LOCK FORKS ON THE INTERPRETER
--------------------------------
``uv.lock`` is not one resolve — it FORKS. Measured: of 73 locked package
names, exactly two resolve to more than one version, both split on the same
boundary, ``python_full_version`` 3.11:

    numpy            2.2.6  (< 3.11)   /  2.4.6  (>= 3.11)
    timezonefinder   8.2.0  (< 3.11)   /  8.2.5  (>= 3.11)

So "the locked set" does not name a single set of versions until the
interpreter is fixed, and a base-image tag edit changes what installs while
``pyproject.toml`` and ``uv.lock`` stay byte-identical.
``.github/dependabot.yml`` watches the ``docker`` ecosystem weekly precisely
so the pinned base image gets CVE-driven bumps, so that edit arrives on its
own schedule.

WHAT THE FORK DOES *NOT* ESTABLISH — READ BEFORE RE-ARGUING IT
--------------------------------------------------------------
An earlier revision of this file claimed the consequence was numeric: that
``numpy`` sits in the served compute path via
``jhora/horoscope/chart/strength.py`` (Shadbala/Bhavabala rounded and summed
through ``np.floor``/``np.rint``/``np.around``) and
``jhora/horoscope/chart/ashtakavarga.py`` (varga tables summed through
``np.asarray(...).sum(axis=0)`` and ``np.multiply``).

**That claim is false, and it is recorded here so it is not reintroduced.**
This project computes Shadbala, Bhavabala and Ashtakavarga *itself*, in
``bphs_core/strength.py``, which contains no numpy at all. ``bphs_core``
imports only ``drik``, ``charts``, ``const`` and ``utils``; ``charts.py`` in
turn imports only ``math``/``drik``/``const``/``utils``/``house``. Both cited
modules ship inside the dependency and are never imported.

Measured 2026-08-05 by wrapping ``np.floor``/``np.rint``/``np.around``/
``np.sum``/``np.asarray``/``np.multiply``/``np.array``/``np.where`` with
counters, with the instrument PROVEN LIVE BEFORE ANY ZERO WAS READ — direct
calls moved every counter, and a direct call into the dependency's own
``get_ashtaka_varga`` moved ``asarray`` 0 -> 1, so a zero below is absence and
not a dead probe:

    every route: the 15 /v1/* plus /healthz     ..  every counter 0
      and /source, 17 of 17 answering 200/202,
      both async scan jobs polled to terminal
      status so worker-thread compute counted
    the full 697-test suite, whole run ...........  2 numpy calls, both
                                                    at import, 0 during
                                                    test execution
    jhora.horoscope.chart.strength ...............  never in sys.modules
    jhora.horoscope.chart.ashtakavarga ...........  never in sys.modules

Those two calls are one expression — the ``house_owners = np.where(...)``
assignment in ``jhora/const.py``, an integer index extraction building a
constant lookup table. Cited by symbol, not by line: it sits in a vendored
dependency whose line numbers move with the pinned version. Whether crossing
the fork perturbs it was measured rather than assumed in either direction: the
expression on the same table yields ``[2, 5, 3, 1, 0, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4]``
under numpy 2.2.6 on python 3.10 and under numpy 2.4.6 on python 3.11, same
values and same element types.

WHAT THIS GUARD ACTUALLY RESTS ON
---------------------------------
What the gating suite tests must be what ships — the 13-package divergence
above. That is the whole of it, and it deliberately does not depend on the
numpy question resolving either way. Two supporting reasons for declaring the
interpreter in exactly one place: the fork leaves "the locked set" ambiguous
while the interpreter floats, and reachability is a property of *today's*
code, not a guarantee — the day something here calls into the dependency's own
strength/ashtakavarga modules, or a new dependency puts float arithmetic on
the served path, the fork stops being inert with nothing in the diff to
announce it.

WHAT THIS GUARD ASSERTS
-----------------------
1. The running interpreter is the pinned one (``.python-version``) — because a
   lock that forks is only one resolve once the interpreter is fixed.
2. Every installed distribution matches what ``uv.lock`` resolves FOR THAT
   INTERPRETER, and the comparison provably included the pins named in
   ``_ACCURACY_CRITICAL`` below.
3. Every CI job that runs the suite installs from the frozen lock and takes
   its interpreter from ``.python-version`` — so the divergence cannot be
   reintroduced in a workflow edit.
4. Both Dockerfiles' base images are on that same pinned interpreter — so the
   base-image bump above cannot silently cross the fork.
5. The uv BUILD TOOL is one version across CI and both images, and no workflow
   installs it from a floating index resolve.
6. Every job that installs the frozen lock also asserts the lock is FRESH.

THE INSTALLER IS PART OF THE RESOLVE TOO
----------------------------------------
Everything above pins what is installed and the interpreter it is installed
for. It said nothing about the tool doing the installing. Measured 2026-08-21
on this repository, three CI steps installed uv with a bare
``python -m pip install --upgrade uv`` — ``test.yml``'s ``test`` and
``swiss-ephemeris`` jobs and ``publish.yml``'s ``test`` job — which resolves
whatever is newest on the index at the moment the job runs, while ``Dockerfile``
and ``Dockerfile.test`` both install uv from a digest-pinned
``FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:<version>@sha256:<digest> AS uv`` stage. So CI could
resolve, sync and test through a *different* uv than the one that builds the
shipped image — the same "the gating suite is not running what ships" shape as
the 13-package divergence, one layer further out.

**Which reference is the source of truth, and why the equality is the
maintenance mechanism rather than a chore.** The Dockerfile reference is
watched: ``.github/dependabot.yml`` runs the ``docker`` ecosystem weekly and
that ecosystem parses ``FROM`` instructions, so a uv release arrives as a pull
request on its own schedule. The workflow's ``version:`` input is watched by
**nothing** — dependabot's ``github-actions`` ecosystem bumps the ``uses:`` ref
of an action, never the value of an input to it. A pin nobody watches is a pin
that rots. Asserting the two are EQUAL is what fixes that: the watched
reference moves first, this test goes red, and the unwatched one has to follow
inside the same reviewed change. That is deliberately the inverse of
``test_dockerfile_image_pins.py::test_the_build_tool_is_installed_from_a_pinned_stage``,
which asserts the *shape* and never a version precisely so it does not fail on
the bumps it exists to enable — nothing here pins a version literal either. The
expected value is DERIVED from the Dockerfiles, so the only thing that can fail
is disagreement.

WHY A SEPARATE FRESHNESS CHECK, AND NOT ``uv sync --locked``
------------------------------------------------------------
``--frozen`` installs ``uv.lock`` exactly as committed and never consults
``pyproject.toml``, so a dependency edit that never got a ``uv lock`` run is
installed and tested as though it had not happened. Measured 2026-08-21 on a
scratch copy of this project's own ``pyproject.toml``/``uv.lock`` pair, with
``pyjhora==4.8.7`` edited to ``==4.8.6`` in ``pyproject.toml`` alone and
``uv.lock`` left byte-identical:

    uv lock --check ..............  exit 1, "the lockfile needs to be updated"
    uv export --frozen ...........  exit 0  <-- the silent pass
    uv export --locked ...........  exit 2

and on the unmodified pair all three exit 0. So the drift is real and
``--frozen`` is blind to it by design.

The fix is an ADDITIONAL ``uv lock --check`` step, not a flip of the install to
``uv sync --locked``, for three reasons. (1) The shipped ``Dockerfile`` installs
with ``uv sync --frozen``; this project's rule is to run the EXACT command CI
runs rather than an equivalent, and flipping only CI would put the image and
its gate on two different install paths — reintroducing a divergence in the act
of closing one. (2) It keeps the ``installs_frozen`` arm of
``test_every_workflow_job_that_runs_the_suite_installs_from_the_frozen_lock``
below intact rather than requiring it to be taught to accept a second spelling.
(3) A stale lock then reports itself as a stale lock, in its own named step,
instead of surfacing as an install failure. Measured cost on the in-sync pair:
``uv lock --check`` resolves offline in ~1 ms and the whole invocation returns
in under 0.1 s.

WHY STRUCTURE AND MEASUREMENT, NOT A LINE-SCAN
----------------------------------------------
Every assertion below reads a parsed representation: ``uv.lock`` and
``pyproject.toml`` through a TOML parser, the workflows through PyYAML, the
Dockerfiles through the instruction parser already proven by
``test_image_bakes_ephemeris.py`` (reused by path, not imported as a package —
``ci/`` has no ``__init__.py`` by design). A ``grep`` for ``uv sync --frozen``
matches the string in a comment, including the comment explaining this guard.

And the comparison itself is asserted to be non-empty: "no differences found"
is vacuously true of a comparison that examined nothing, so the number of
distributions compared is printed and floored against the project's own
declared runtime dependencies.
