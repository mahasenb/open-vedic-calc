"""The stable-anchor citation convention is ENFORCED here, not merely observed.

PR #71 converted this tree's rotted ``file:line`` citations to **stable
anchors**: a citation names the SYMBOL it points at -- and, where the claim is
about containment, the enclosing function that holds it -- instead of a line
number that moves under the next edit above it.  That sweep was a one-time
measurement taken against one commit.  This module is the standing guard.  It
re-derives the anchor inventory from ``git ls-files`` on every run and asserts
that every anchor still resolves to a real symbol, so a rename that orphans a
citation reds CI instead of quietly minting fresh rot.

CLAUDE.md's own rule is that *a citation that rots silently is worse than none*.
Nothing in the tree enforced it until this file existed.

THE DISPATCH -- which citation forms this guard READS
=====================================================

The corpus is every tracked ``.py`` / ``.md`` / ``.yml`` / ``.yaml`` / ``.toml``
file, reduced to **prose only**: Python comments (via ``tokenize``) and
docstrings (via ``ast``), ``#`` comment lines in YAML/TOML, and the whole body of
Markdown.  Code string literals are deliberately outside the corpus -- see the
exclusions.  Soft-wrapped prose is rejoined first (a prose line ending in ``_``
is a mid-identifier break, so it joins with no separator), because an anchor
that wraps across two comment lines is still one anchor.

**Form A -- node-id anchor**  ``<module-ref>.py::<name>[::<name>...]``
    The pytest node-id spelling, used in Markdown, comments and docstrings alike.
    ``<module-ref>`` is resolved against tracked files by exact path first, then
    by unique path suffix (so a bare ``chart.py::_build_varga_chart`` resolves,
    and an ambiguous basename is a FAILURE naming every candidate, never a
    guess).  Each ``<name>`` in the chain must be a real symbol at the matching
    scope, found by parsing the target's AST -- never by grepping it.

**Form B -- declared-module bullet anchor**
    A class docstring that opens a block with ``named by function in <path>:``
    or ``named by symbol in <path>:``, followed by bullets of the shape::

        - ``symbol`` -- what this test covers about it
        - ``enclosing`` -> ``callee`` -- what this test covers about the pair

    Each leading ``symbol`` must exist at module scope in the declared path
    (functions, classes and module-level assignments alike -- ``named by
    symbol`` exists precisely because one bullet names a table, not a def, and
    that table is assigned inside a module-level ``try``/``except``).  When a
    bullet names an ``enclosing -> callee`` pair, the CONTAINMENT is verified
    too: ``callee`` must actually be called somewhere inside ``enclosing``'s
    body.  Both halves resolving separately is not enough -- the arrow is a
    claim about where the callee lives.

**Form C -- declared-module member anchor**
    Inside a class carrying a Form B declaration, a test method whose docstring
    opens ``<symbol>: ...``.  ``<symbol>`` resolves against that class's declared
    module.  This is the bulk of the inventory and the form most exposed to rot,
    because the docstring sits far from the symbol it names.

**Form D -- SHA-pinned historical citation**  ``<sha> ... <path>:<line>``
    The one citation form that CANNOT rot, and so the one ``file:line`` form the
    convention keeps: a dated measurement pinned to an immutable commit.  It is
    VERIFIED rather than excluded -- ``git`` must resolve the SHA to a commit,
    the path must exist in that commit's tree, the file must be long enough to
    have the cited line, and that line must not be blank.  Excluding it would
    have been the cheaper choice and a worse one: a pin nobody checks is a pin
    that can name a commit that was never pushed.

**Form E -- the residue check** (``test_no_unpinned_file_line_citation_survives``)
    Every ``<path>:<line>`` in the corpus must be a Form D pin.  This is what
    makes PR #71 a standing convention instead of a snapshot: a fresh
    line-number citation reds here on the commit that introduces it.

WHAT THIS GUARD DELIBERATELY DOES NOT READ
==========================================

A documented boundary beats a false-positive storm.  Each exclusion below is a
measurement, not a shrug.

1.  **Prose backtick mentions.**  CLAUDE.md is full of ``` `symbol` ``` and
    ``` `module.py`'s `symbol()` ``` written as English, not as citations
    (``the `swe.houses` call in `Chart._compute```).  There is no syntactic
    difference between a prose mention of a name and a citation to it, so
    reading them means guessing.  They are covered indirectly: nearly all of
    them name a symbol that also appears in a Form A/B/C anchor.

2.  **Bare ``# <ident>: ...`` comment anchors with no module declaration.**
    ``tests/test_compat_deep.py`` carries a block of these (``# _vasya: `ga ==
    gb` same-group tier``); how many is deliberately not written here, because a
    hand-typed count in prose is the same defect class as a hand-typed line
    number.  They are genuine anchors, but the module they resolve
    against is stated only in English in the file's module docstring, so
    selecting them means selecting every ``word:`` clause in every comment in
    the tree.  Measured over the corpus, that selector also returns
    ``Additive:``, ``False:``, ``Measured:`` and ``navamsa:`` -- none of them
    citations.  Bringing this file's anchors under the guard needs a
    machine-readable module declaration (the Form B header, lifted to module
    scope); that is a deliberate convention change, reported upward rather than
    smuggled in here.

3.  **Code string literals.**  ``ci/tests/test_pytest_collection_check.py``
    holds synthetic pytest ``--deselect`` argv fixtures spelled as node-ids, one
    of them naming a ``tests/x.py`` module that does not exist and must not.
    They are Form A shaped and are not citations.  Restricting the corpus to
    comments and docstrings excludes them by construction rather than by a
    name-based allowlist that would need maintaining.

    Corollary, and it applies to this docstring: **the grammar has no
    placeholder escape.**  Anything Form A shaped in tracked prose is read as a
    citation, here included, so the grammar above is written with angle-bracket
    metavariables and every concrete example given is a real, resolving anchor.
    That is a property worth keeping -- an escape hatch is a way to write rot
    that the guard agrees to ignore.

4.  **Citations into vendored dependencies.**  CLAUDE.md cites
    ``jhora/const.py``'s ``house_owners`` assignment by symbol precisely because
    that file is not in this tree.  Its line numbers move with the pin, and its
    symbols are not resolvable from ``git ls-files``.  Anchors whose module-ref
    is not a tracked file are reported as unresolvable, so a vendored target
    must be cited in prose (as it is), never in Form A.

5.  **Non-Python anchor targets.**  Form A requires a ``.py`` module-ref.  There
    is no AST for a workflow step or a Markdown heading, so ``test.yml::<step>``
    has no defined resolution and the grammar does not admit it.

NON-VACUITY
===========

``test_the_anchor_inventory_meets_its_floor`` refuses an empty or shrunken
corpus.  "Every anchor resolves" is vacuously true of zero anchors, and a regex
that silently stops matching is exactly how a guard dies quietly.  The floors
are therefore asserted PER FORM rather than only in total, so one form going
dark cannot hide behind the others -- and PER CHUNK KIND as well, because the
corpus feeds only Forms A and D: Forms B and C re-parse ASTs directly, so half
the corpus can vanish while their counts sit untouched.  That is measured, not
supposed; the constant block below carries the numbers.
