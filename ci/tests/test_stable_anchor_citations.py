"""The stable-anchor citation convention is ENFORCED here, not merely observed.

PR #71 converted this tree's rotted ``file:line`` citations to **stable
anchors**: a citation names the SYMBOL it points at -- and, where the claim is
about containment, the enclosing function that holds it -- instead of a line
number that moves under the next edit above it.  That sweep was a one-time
measurement taken against one commit.  This module is the standing guard.  It
re-derives the anchor inventory from ``git ls-files`` on every run and asserts
that every anchor still resolves to a real symbol, so a rename that orphans a
citation reds CI instead of quietly minting fresh rot.

CLAUDE.md's own rule is that *a citation that rots silently is worse than none*.
Nothing in the tree enforced it until this file existed.

THE DISPATCH -- which citation forms this guard READS
=====================================================

The corpus is every tracked ``.py`` / ``.md`` / ``.yml`` / ``.yaml`` / ``.toml``
file, reduced to **prose only**: Python comments (via ``tokenize``) and
docstrings (via ``ast``), ``#`` comment lines in YAML/TOML, and the whole body of
Markdown.  Code string literals are deliberately outside the corpus -- see the
exclusions.  Soft-wrapped prose is rejoined first (a prose line ending in ``_``
is a mid-identifier break, so it joins with no separator), because an anchor
that wraps across two comment lines is still one anchor.

**Form A -- node-id anchor**  ``<module-ref>.py::<name>[::<name>...]``
    The pytest node-id spelling, used in Markdown, comments and docstrings alike.
    ``<module-ref>`` is resolved against tracked files by exact path first, then
    by unique path suffix (so a bare ``chart.py::_build_varga_chart`` resolves,
    and an ambiguous basename is a FAILURE naming every candidate, never a
    guess).  Each ``<name>`` in the chain must be a real symbol at the matching
    scope, found by parsing the target's AST -- never by grepping it.

**Form B -- declared-module bullet anchor**
    A **class or module** docstring that opens a block with ``named by function
    in <path>:`` or ``named by symbol in <path>:``, followed by bullets of the
    shape::

        - ``symbol`` -- what this test covers about it
        - ``enclosing`` -> ``callee`` -- what this test covers about the pair

    Each leading ``symbol`` must exist at module scope in the declared path
    (functions, classes and module-level assignments alike -- ``named by
    symbol`` exists precisely because one bullet names a table, not a def, and
    that table is assigned inside a module-level ``try``/``except``).  When a
    bullet names an ``enclosing -> callee`` pair, the CONTAINMENT is verified
    too: ``callee`` must actually be called somewhere inside ``enclosing``'s
    body.  Both halves resolving separately is not enough -- the arrow is a
    claim about where the callee lives.

    A scope declares exactly ONE subject module.  Two declarations in one
    docstring are a hard failure rather than "take the first", because the
    second would be silently ignored and every anchor written for it would
    resolve against the wrong module or, worse, coincidentally against the
    right-looking one.  Anchors into a second module are spelled in Form A.

**Form C -- declared-module member anchor**
    Inside a class carrying a Form B declaration, a test method whose docstring
    opens ``<symbol>: ...``.  ``<symbol>`` resolves against that class's declared
    module.  This is the bulk of the inventory and the form most exposed to rot,
    because the docstring sits far from the symbol it names.

**Form D -- SHA-pinned historical citation**  ``<sha> ... <path>:<line>``
    The one citation form that CANNOT rot, and so the one ``file:line`` form the
    convention keeps: a dated measurement pinned to an immutable commit.  It is
    VERIFIED rather than excluded -- ``git`` must resolve the SHA to a commit,
    the path must exist in that commit's tree, the file must be long enough to
    have the cited line, and that line must not be blank.  Excluding it would
    have been the cheaper choice and a worse one: a pin nobody checks is a pin
    that can name a commit that was never pushed.

**Form E -- the residue check** (``test_no_unpinned_file_line_citation_survives``)
    Every ``<path>:<line>`` in the corpus must be a Form D pin.  This is what
    makes PR #71 a standing convention instead of a snapshot: a fresh
    line-number citation reds here on the commit that introduces it.

**Form F -- declared-module comment anchor**  ``# <symbol>: ...``
    A comment line opening with an identifier and a colon, inside a file whose
    MODULE docstring carries the Form B header.  ``<symbol>`` resolves at module
    scope of the declared path, exactly as Form C's does.

    This form was exclusion #2 below until the header was lifted to module
    scope.  The anchors were always genuine; what they lacked was an owner a
    machine could read.  A comment has no enclosing AST node to inherit one
    from -- which is the whole reason a *module*-scope declaration was the
    missing piece, and the reason Form C remains class-scoped: a method
    docstring already has an owning scope and does not need the file to speak
    for it.

    The declaration is what removes the guesswork rather than tolerating it: the
    selector runs ONLY inside files that opted in, so a ``word:`` comment opener
    there IS a citation by construction, and the cost -- prose in that shape can
    no longer be written in a declared file -- is stated in each declaring
    docstring rather than discovered by whoever reds the build.

WHAT THIS GUARD DELIBERATELY DOES NOT READ
==========================================

A documented boundary beats a false-positive storm.  Each exclusion below is a
measurement, not a shrug.

1.  **Prose backtick mentions.**  CLAUDE.md is full of ``` `symbol` ``` and
    ``` `module.py`'s `symbol()` ``` written as English, not as citations
    (``the `swe.houses` call in `Chart._compute```).  There is no syntactic
    difference between a prose mention of a name and a citation to it, so
    reading them means guessing.  They are covered indirectly: nearly all of
    them name a symbol that also appears in a Form A/B/C anchor.

2.  **Bare ``# <ident>: ...`` comment anchors in a file that declares NO module.**
    This exclusion used to be unconditional, and the reason was real: the module
    such an anchor resolves against was stated only in English, so selecting
    them meant selecting every ``word:`` clause in every comment in the tree,
    and measured over the corpus that selector also returns ``Additive:``,
    ``False:``, ``Measured:`` and ``navamsa:`` -- none of them citations.

    The convention change that removes the guesswork has now landed: the Form B
    header is admissible in a MODULE docstring, and a file that opts in has its
    comment anchors read as Form F above.  ``tests/test_compat_deep.py`` and
    ``tests/test_panchanga_fail_closed.py``, the two files this exclusion named,
    both declare.  How many anchors they carry is deliberately not written here
    -- a hand-typed count in prose is the same defect class as a hand-typed line
    number; the floor test prints the live number on every run.

    What remains excluded is a comment anchor in an UNDECLARED file, and it
    stays excluded on the same evidence as before.  The fix is one line of
    declaration, not a widened selector.

3.  **Code string literals.**  ``ci/tests/test_pytest_collection_check.py``
    holds synthetic pytest ``--deselect`` argv fixtures spelled as node-ids, one
    of them naming a ``tests/x.py`` module that does not exist and must not.
    They are Form A shaped and are not citations.  Restricting the corpus to
    comments and docstrings excludes them by construction rather than by a
    name-based allowlist that would need maintaining.

    Corollary, and it applies to this docstring: **the grammar has no
    placeholder escape.**  Anything Form A shaped in tracked prose is read as a
    citation, here included, so the grammar above is written with angle-bracket
    metavariables and every concrete example given is a real, resolving anchor.
    That is a property worth keeping -- an escape hatch is a way to write rot
    that the guard agrees to ignore.

4.  **Citations into vendored dependencies.**  CLAUDE.md cites
    ``jhora/const.py``'s ``house_owners`` assignment by symbol precisely because
    that file is not in this tree.  Its line numbers move with the pin, and its
    symbols are not resolvable from ``git ls-files``.  Anchors whose module-ref
    is not a tracked file are reported as unresolvable, so a vendored target
    must be cited in prose (as it is), never in Form A.

5.  **Non-Python anchor targets.**  Form A requires a ``.py`` module-ref.  There
    is no AST for a workflow step or a Markdown heading, so ``test.yml::<step>``
    has no defined resolution and the grammar does not admit it.

NON-VACUITY
===========

``test_the_anchor_inventory_meets_its_floor`` refuses an empty or shrunken
corpus.  "Every anchor resolves" is vacuously true of zero anchors, and a regex
that silently stops matching is exactly how a guard dies quietly.  The floors
are therefore asserted PER FORM rather than only in total, so one form going
dark cannot hide behind the others -- and PER CHUNK KIND as well, because the
corpus feeds Forms A, D and F: Forms B and C re-parse ASTs directly, so half the
corpus can vanish while their counts sit untouched.  That is measured, not
supposed; the constant block below carries the numbers.

Form F needs one floor MORE than its own count, and it is the one floor here set
at equality: the module-scope declarations that admit it.  A floor counting
class-scope and module-scope declarations together keeps clearing on the
class-scope ones alone, while Form F quietly finds nothing to read.

# THIS BLOCK CARRIES NO INVENTORY COUNTS, AND THAT IS THE POINT.  It used to
# open with a narrative measurement -- so many files, so many chunks, so many
# anchors per form -- and that narrative went stale TWICE: once before it was
# first committed, having been measured before this file's own docstrings
# finished growing, and once again on the very branch that recorded the first
# lapse, where the figures were taken at the branch's opening commit and three
# later commits then moved them.  A hand-typed count of live tree state, sitting
# in the guard whose entire purpose is to stop hand-typed references rotting, is
# the one place the defect must not survive.  So the numbers are gone rather
# than re-typed: the only figures here are the floors below, which are ASSERTED
# on every run, and the live inventory, which `test_the_anchor_inventory_meets_
# its_floor` PRINTS on every run.  Read them there; nothing in this comment can
# disagree with the tree because nothing in it describes the tree.
#
# WHY THE FLOORS EXIST.  Every assertion in this module has the form "each
# anchor resolves", which is vacuously true of no anchors at all.  A regex that
# stops matching, a corpus extractor returning nothing, or a `git ls-files` that
# fails open would each turn the whole module green while checking nothing.
#
# WHY PER FORM.  A single total lets one form go dark behind the others' growth.
#
# WHY PER CHUNK KIND.  Measured: making `python_chunks` drop comments while
# keeping docstrings costs the entire comment half of the corpus, and every
# other floor here still passes -- Forms B and C never read the chunk corpus at
# all (they re-parse ASTs directly), and Form D's lone citation lives in a
# docstring.  The guard would stay GREEN with every Python comment in the tree
# unread, and a per-kind floor is the only thing that sees it.
#
# WHY ONE FLOOR IS AN EQUALITY.  `_MIN_MODULE_DECLARATIONS` matches exactly what
# the tree holds, deliberately: the module-scope declarations are what admit
# Form F at all, so deleting one must red here rather than quietly returning
# those anchors to the unguarded state they spent PR #74 in.
# `_MIN_DECLARED_MODULES` deliberately does NOT absorb them -- a floor counting
# class-scope and module-scope declarations together keeps clearing on the
# class-scope ones alone while the module-scope half is gone.
