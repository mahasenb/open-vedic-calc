"""Refuse a pytest configuration that removes tests from every run in this repo.

WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A TEST
-----------------------------------
``ci/tests/test_swiss_ephemeris_job.py`` guards the accuracy job's *run line* and
its *environment*, and it does so as a pytest test. That works for every vector
that lives in the workflow file. It cannot work for this one, and the reason is
worth stating precisely rather than discovering again later:

**a pytest test cannot police a pytest setting that stops pytest running tests.**

``addopts`` in ``pyproject.toml`` applies to EVERY pytest invocation in this
repository — the fast ``test`` job, the ``swiss-ephemeris`` accuracy job, and the
``ci/tests/`` guard suite alike. Measured on this branch, appending three lines to
``pyproject.toml`` and running ``pytest ci/tests/ -q``:

  ``addopts = "-k not_corpus"``      -> exit 5, 88 deselected   (pytest itself fails)
  ``addopts = "-k 'not corpus'"``    -> exit 1                  (the pytest guard reds)
  ``addopts = "-m 'not nothing'"``   -> exit 1                  (the pytest guard reds)
  ``addopts = "-k 'not narrow'"``    -> **exit 0**, 87 passed, 1 deselected
  ``addopts = "--collect-only"``     -> **exit 0**, 88 collected, 0 executed

The last two are fail-open. ``--collect-only`` is the worst of them: it deselects
nothing, so every module is still collected and every reachability check still
answers "yes, the job reaches it" — while not one test body executes and the whole
workflow reports green. The pytest-resident guard cannot catch either case, because
under both it is the thing that did not run.

So this check runs as a plain ``python`` step. Nothing in pytest's configuration can
deselect, skip, or no-op it.

WHAT IT REFUSES
---------------
1. A narrowing ``addopts`` in ``pyproject.toml``: anything that deselects tests
   (``-k``, ``-m``, ``--ignore``, ``--ignore-glob``, ``--deselect``) or that collects
   without running them (``--collect-only``, ``--co``). A non-narrowing ``addopts``
   (``-q``, ``--strict-markers``, ...) is perfectly legitimate and is not flagged —
   this is about what removes assertions from a run, not about whether addopts is used.
2. The presence of any OTHER file pytest reads ini options from, ANYWHERE IN THE
   TREE. pytest honours ``pytest.ini``, ``.pytest.ini``, ``tox.ini`` and
   ``setup.cfg`` as well as ``pyproject.toml``. Only the repo-root
   ``pyproject.toml`` exists here and only it is parsed, so any of the other four
   is **refused on sight** — not parsed, not judged for narrowing-ness, refused.
   Extending this checker to parse one is the deliberate act that clears the
   refusal, and that act lands the day one is legitimately added.

   THE ROOT IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE THEY COUNT, and assuming it was is a defect this
   check shipped with. pytest resolves its inifile by walking UP from the common
   ancestor of its arguments, so a config file sitting in a directory the suite is
   invoked against WINS over the root ``pyproject.toml``. Measured on this repo
   with one file added::

       tests/pytest.ini  ==  [pytest]\\naddopts = --collect-only
       python ci/check_pytest_collection.py
           -> "OK: pytest configuration does not narrow collection.", exit 0
       REQUIRE_SWISS_EPHEMERIS=1 python -m pytest tests/ -q
           -> "937 tests collected", 0 executed, exit 0

   The root-only scan reported clean while every assertion in the suite had been
   removed — the same fail-open the ``--collect-only`` case above describes, in a
   directory nothing looked at. ``tests/pyproject.toml`` carrying
   ``[tool.pytest.ini_options] addopts = "--collect-only"`` did the same. The scan
   now covers the whole working tree, scoped by ``git ls-files --cached --others
   --exclude-standard`` so the exclusions come from ``.gitignore`` rather than from
   a hand-kept list here (``.venv/Lib/site-packages`` alone carries dozens of
   third-party ``setup.cfg``/``tox.ini`` files, every one a false refusal under a
   naive walk). A NESTED ``pyproject.toml`` is judged on content rather than on
   sight, because a subpackage manifest is a legitimate thing to add and the other
   four are not.

3. A narrowing ``PYTEST_ADDOPTS`` in **this process's own environment**. A
   workflow- or job-level ``env:`` block lands here too, so an injection that
   silences every pytest run in the job also kills this step — loudly, and before
   the suite it would have silenced. ``--self-test`` refuses first for the same
   reason: it must not certify a detector from inside an already-narrowed
   environment.

4. ``PYTEST_ADDOPTS`` **anywhere in the workflow files** — every job, all three
   ``env:`` levels, and **any mention at all inside a ``run:`` body**. This is the
   placement (3) cannot see: a step-level ``env:``, or a ``$GITHUB_ENV`` write, on
   a *sibling* step never enters this process.

   (3) is narrowing-only; (4) is presence-only. Deliberate: a contributor's shell
   may legitimately carry ``PYTEST_ADDOPTS=-q``, and redding on that would teach
   people to distrust this check — but a workflow file has no legitimate reason to
   name the variable at all, and judging an arbitrary value's narrowing-ness means
   reimplementing pytest's argument parser.

   THE RUN-BODY RULE IS PRESENCE BECAUSE MODELLING FAILED. An earlier version
   analysed argv position — a leading ``VAR=value`` prefix, or an argument to
   ``export``. Both of those are shell-LOCAL: every ``run:`` is a fresh shell, so
   neither escapes its own body. The form that actually reaches a later step is
   GitHub Actions' own cross-step mechanism, ``echo "VAR=value" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"``,
   where the assignment is an argument to ``echo`` and the position check said no.
   Measured with one such line appended to the swiss job's install step: this
   checker exited 0 "OK", all 149 guard tests passed, and the accuracy step would
   then have run under ``--collect-only``. See ``run_body_names_addopts``.

KNOWN BOUND, stated rather than left implicit: this scans the workflow files in
``.github/workflows``. A composite or reusable action pulled in with ``uses:`` can
write ``$GITHUB_ENV`` from a file outside this repository, and nothing here reads
that. Closing it would mean resolving and fetching third-party action source — a
different kind of check. Recorded as a bound of this control, not a claim of
completeness.

PARSED, NEVER GREPPED. ``# addopts = "-k not_corpus"`` is a comment and must stay
invisible; a grep would red on it and a reader would then learn to distrust this
check. The TOML is parsed and the value is shell-split the way pytest splits it.

Usage
-----
    python ci/check_pytest_collection.py            # 0 clean, 1 refused
    python ci/check_pytest_collection.py --self-test

Exit codes: 0 = no narrowing configuration; 1 = refused (with the reason printed).

    dozens of third-party `setup.cfg` and `tox.ini` files, and every one of them
    would be a false refusal under a naive walk.

    `-z`, AND BYTES, AND NO SEPARATOR REWRITE — three halves of one fix, each
    load-bearing. Measured on the commit before it, against a fixture repo
    holding `caf<e-acute><s-caron>/pytest.ini` with `addopts = --collect-only`:
    this returned `['"caf/303/251/305/241/pytest.ini"', 'plain.txt']` and the
    scan reported CLEAN. `git ls-files` quotes a path carrying non-ASCII bytes
    (`core.quotePath` defaults on), wrapping it in literal double quotes and
    rendering each byte as a backslash-octal escape; the basename then read back
    as `pytest.ini"` and matched nothing. The old `.replace("\\", "/")` — there
    to normalise Windows separators — then rewrote those escapes into fabricated
    directory separators. `-z` disables quoting entirely and NUL-separates the
    records, so a path arrives verbatim whatever bytes it holds and whatever
    `core.quotePath` is set to; git emits `/` separators on every platform, so
    the rewrite has nothing left to do and is removed rather than left to
    corrupt a literal backslash in a POSIX filename. Records are not stripped
    either: with `-z` they are exact, and a leading or trailing space is a legal
    filename character.

    The decode happens HERE, on bytes, not inside subprocess. In text mode it
    happens on a reader thread, where — measured — a UnicodeDecodeError kills
    the thread and hands back `stdout=None` with `returncode=0`, so the next
    `.splitlines()` raised `AttributeError` out of a checker whose contract is
    to reach a verdict. A filename need not be valid UTF-8 on a POSIX
    filesystem, so that is a reachable input, not a hypothetical one. An
