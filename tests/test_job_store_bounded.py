"""FR-MED-21 — the async JobStore must not grow without bound.

``submit()`` used to insert into ``self._jobs`` and nothing ever removed an
entry (``get()`` only reads), so a long-lived container fielding a steady
trickle of scan submissions would grow the dict -- and every completed job's
retained result/error payload -- forever, eventually OOM-killing the process.
``JobStore`` now caps itself at ``max_jobs`` entries, evicting the oldest
terminal (``done``/``error``) jobs first once the cap is exceeded.
