"""Per-limb failure-mode contract for ``compute_muhurat_for_day``.

Project decision, 2026-08-17: **a limb failure that can change WHICH time is
recommended must RAISE (fail loud); only genuinely supplementary limbs may
degrade, and then only behind an explicit per-limb flag.**

The module used to answer every limb failure the same way — a log line plus a
default, a dropped window, or a ``None`` — so a day assembled from a broken
frame was indistinguishable on the wire from a day assembled from a good one.
Two properties close that, and this file is their contract:

* Every limb whose failure moves the recommendation raises
  :class:`~bphs_core.muhurat.MuhurtaLimbError`, which names the limb.
* Every remaining limb degrades **visibly**: the served field falls back to its
  documented sentinel, the limb's own name is appended to ``degraded_limbs``,
  and the summary ``degraded`` flag is derived from that list, so the two can
  never disagree.

Why the split is drawn where it is — measured against the scan pipeline, not
assumed. ``bphs_core/lagna_shuddhi.py`` builds the entire candidate-minute set
for a day from ``auspicious_muhurtas`` + the favourable ``chogadiya`` windows
(``_candidate_minutes``); it hard-excludes on the Rahu/Yamaganda/Gulika windows
and, per activity, on Durmuhurtam/Varjyam, the Vishti karana, the eclipse flag
and the adhika-maasa flag; it scores on the tithi/yoga names and derives the
hora lord from the served ``sunrise``. A limb feeding any of those decides which
minute is recommended, and a dropped window or a ``None`` there does not make
the engine cautious — it silently deletes a veto or a candidate. The limbs with
**zero** reads anywhere in the scan pipeline (moonrise, moonset, the four
end-times, the amrita windows, the 30-muhurta display table, the personal
balam strings) are the ones that may degrade.

``TestEveryDrikLimbIsClassified`` is the guard on the split itself: it discovers
the ``drik`` entry points by PARSING the module (not grepping it), requires each
one to carry a recorded classification, and drives each to failure to confirm
the recorded outcome is the one that actually happens. A limb added later
without a classification fails here rather than shipping silent.

    The point of raising is what the CALLER sees. A limb error is surfaced by
    the synchronous route as a structured 422 naming the failed limb (register
    #285) rather than being rendered into a 200 carrying a partial day, and
    rather than an opaque 500 the caller cannot attribute to a limb — 'an empty
    field a consumer cannot distinguish from a real answer is worse than a 500'
    is this repo's own standing rule, and this is the case it was written for.
    The route envelope itself is pinned in tests/test_muhurat_limb_error_route.py;
    this case proves the real engine raise reaches that envelope end to end.
