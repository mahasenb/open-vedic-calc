"""The swisseph position-flag word is a DECLARED choice, not an inherited default.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
Every planetary longitude this engine serves comes from ``swe.calc_ut(jd, body,
flags)``. That third argument — a bit word — decides the *reference frame* the
number is expressed in: geometric or apparent position, with or without
gravitational deflection, with or without nutation, sidereal or tropical. It is
not a tuning knob; it is part of what the answer means.

Until this module existed the engine stated that word nowhere. It inherited
``jhora.panchanga.drik.PLANET_FLAGS``, which the astronomy library builds at ITS
import time from ``jhora.const.PLANET_POSITIONS_*`` module globals. Measured
2026-07-31, the same repository on two dependency resolves:

    pyjhora 4.8.6, pyswisseph 2.10.3.2   drik.PLANET_FLAGS = 66386
    pyjhora 4.8.7 (one patch release)    drik.PLANET_FLAGS = 65810

a difference of 576 = FLG_NOGDEFL (512) | FLG_NONUT (64), because 4.8.7 flipped
``const.PLANET_POSITIONS_USE_DEFLECTION`` and ``const.PLANET_POSITIONS_USE_NUTATION``
from ``False`` to ``True``. No file in this repository changed. Nothing went red
except this module's tripwire — which is the whole reason it exists.

THAT BUMP HAS SINCE BEEN TAKEN (2026-08-21). The pin is ``pyjhora==4.8.7`` and
the declaration is now 65810. Evidence recorded at the time, on the 4.8.7
resolve with the old 66386 declaration still in place: ``pytest tests/`` produced
**41 collection errors**, every one of them the applier's RuntimeError, while
``pytest ci/tests/`` stayed green at 155 passed — i.e. the tripwire was the only
thing in the repository that could see the move, exactly as designed.

WHY RE-DECLARING WAS SAFE — measured, not argued. Requesting each word from
swisseph for Mercury at 2000-01-01 12:00 UT returns the SAME retflag:

    requested 66386 -> retflag 67410 (swisseph adds FLG_NOABERR)
    requested 65810 -> retflag 67410 (swisseph adds FLG_NONUT|FLG_NOGDEFL|FLG_NOABERR)

so under FLG_TRUEPOS the two requests converge on one effective word inside the
library and are the same computation, not merely a close one. Confirmed on
output over 72 graha-epoch pairs (8 grahas x 9 epochs across
1800-01-01..2400-12-31): longitude and daily speed BIT-identical, compared as
packed IEEE-754 bits rather than against a tolerance, with 56 pairs answered by
the real Swiss data files and 16 by the Moshier fallback.

The two flags are masked by DIFFERENT things, and the applier now enforces that:
FLG_NOGDEFL by FLG_TRUEPOS, FLG_NONUT by FLG_SIDEREAL. Clearing FLG_TRUEPOS
stops swisseph adding NOGDEFL back (requested 66370 -> retflag 66370, nothing
added) while NONUT is still added for a sidereal request (requested 65794 ->
retflag 65858).

WHAT THE THREE GOVERNING FLAGS ARE ACTUALLY WORTH
-------------------------------------------------
Measured with the frozen resolve against the real Swiss ephemeris data files,
scanning 1800-01-01..2400-12-31 (the data files' full label span — WIDER than
the served birth-date bound; see MIN_EPHEMERIS_DATE / MAX_EPHEMERIS_DATE in
app/schemas.py) one day at a time — 219511 days x 9 grahas:

  FLG_TRUEPOS (geometric vs apparent position)
      max |declared - apparent| = 0.016817256 deg = 60.5421 arcsec
      (Mercury, JD 2580641.5 = 2353-06-16 00:00 UT)
      per graha: Mercury 60.5421", Venus 44.7711", Mars 38.9693",
      Jupiter 30.0595", Saturn 27.2519", Sun 20.8489", Moon 0.7632",
      Rahu/Ketu 0.0146"

  FLG_NOGDEFL + FLG_NONUT (the 576 that moved between the two resolves)
      max |with - without| = 0.000000000 deg = 0.000000 arcsec, every graha,
      every one of those 219511 days

The second result is the whole point, and it cuts both ways. The dependency's
flag word moved and **no committed golden could ever have caught it**, because
under FLG_TRUEPOS swisseph ignores deflection and aberration entirely, and for a
sidereal request it applies FLG_NONUT of its own accord (visible in the retflag:
a request of FLG_SWIEPH|FLG_SIDEREAL returns 65602, which carries FLG_NONUT that
nobody asked for). So the 576 is inert — but inert *conditionally*, masked by a
different flag that is inherited from the same undeclared source. Clear
FLG_TRUEPOS and the mask lifts: measured at century steps across the same span,
FLG_NOGDEFL is then worth 0.0711 arcsec and FLG_NOABERR would be worth 20.8557
arcsec. Three inherited defaults, coupled, with one of them deciding whether the
other two matter, is not a frame anyone chose.

THE LEVERS
----------
Measured, not read from documentation:

  1. ``jhora.const.PLANET_POSITIONS_GEOCENTRIC / _TRUE / _USE_ABERRATION /
     _USE_DEFLECTION / _USE_NUTATION`` — five module globals read by
     ``jhora.utils.set_flags_for_planet_positions()`` every time it is called.
     This is the *inherited default*, and it is what moved between 4.8.6 and
     4.8.7.
  2. ``drik.PLANET_FLAGS`` — a MUTABLE module global, built from (1) at drik's
     own import time, which is before anything in this package has run. This is
     the word that actually serves: ``drik.sidereal_longitude``,
     ``drik.dhasavarga`` (and therefore ``charts.rasi_chart``) and
     ``drik.planets_in_retrograde`` all read it at call time.
  3. ``jhora.const._TROPICAL_MODE`` — when true, ``drik.sidereal_longitude``
     ignores ``PLANET_FLAGS`` completely and computes with
     ``FLG_SWIEPH + FLG_SPEED``, i.e. tropical. A pinned word that is bypassed
     is not a pin, so the applier verifies this too.

``bphs_core.utils.apply_position_flags`` compares (1) against the declaration and
refuses to start on any disagreement, pins (2) and reads it back, and verifies
(3). It is called at ``bphs_core.utils`` import, and ``bphs_core/__init__.py``
imports utils first, so the pin lands before any sibling module uses drik.

WHAT THIS DECLARATION DOES *NOT* COVER
--------------------------------------
Stated rather than left to be discovered. ``POSITION_FLAGS`` is the *planetary
position* word only:

  * the ascendant and the Bhava-Chalit cusps come from
    ``swe.houses(jd_utc, lat, lon, b"P")`` in ``bphs_core/chart.py``, which takes
    no flag word at all (tropical cusps, with the ayanamsa subtracted by this
    repo — see the Julian Day discipline in CLAUDE.md);
  * sunrise/sunset use pyjhora's separate ``drik.RISE_FLAGS`` / ``drik.SET_FLAGS``
    words, measured 897 / 898 and IDENTICAL in 4.8.6 and 4.8.7, so they did not
    move — and are now declared in their own right by
    ``bphs_core.utils.apply_rise_set_flags``, contract ``tests/test_rise_set_flags.py``.

WHAT IS ASSERTED HERE
---------------------
The positive signal, never the absence of an error:

  * the word is stated as a literal in this repo and decomposes into named
    swisseph constants, so a reader learns the reference frame without running
    anything;
  * each of the governing flags is individually asserted present, and the flags
    deliberately NOT taken (FLG_NOABERR, FLG_TOPOCTR, FLG_J2000, and since the
    4.8.7 bump FLG_NOGDEFL and FLG_NONUT) are asserted absent;
  * the MASKING INVARIANT that makes those last two safe to omit: each is mapped
    to the declared flag that makes swisseph apply it unasked, that mapping is
    re-proved against swisseph's own retflag rather than trusted, and the applier
    refuses to start if a masking flag ever leaves the declaration while the flag
    it masks is absent. This is what replaces declaring the pair outright;
  * the astronomy library's own inherited word equals the declaration — this is
    the dependency-bump tripwire, and it is what would have gone red on the
    4.8.6 -> 4.8.7 move that no golden could see;
  * the serving global carries the declaration, and importing the package is
    what puts it there;
  * a REAL served graha and a REAL served Chart equal a direct computation under
    the declared word to float noise, and are 60.54 arcsec away from the same
    computation under an apparent-position word — so these cannot pass if the
    served frame were quietly something else;
  * the applier fails CLOSED on every lever: inherited default moved, builder
    gone, pin refused, tropical bypass live, declaration inconsistent with its
    own decomposition.

Everything here holds under BOTH ephemeris runtimes. Measured at the epoch used
below: the served value matches the direct declared-word computation to
0.000000 arcsec on Swiss data and on the Moshier fallback alike, and the
declared-vs-apparent separation for Mercury is 60.5421 arcsec on Swiss data and
60.5422 arcsec on Moshier.
