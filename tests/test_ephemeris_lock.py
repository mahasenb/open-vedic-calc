"""Process-wide serialization of Swiss-Ephemeris / pyjhora C-library access.

pyswisseph and pyjhora carry process-global mutable state (the ephemeris
path set at import in ``bphs_core/utils.py`` and the sidereal/ayanamsa mode
that ``Chart._compute`` re-asserts on every call), and the underlying Swiss
Ephemeris C library is not documented as safe for concurrent
``swe_calc``/``swe_houses`` calls from multiple threads. Two compute paths
now run concurrently in one process: Starlette's per-request thread pool for
the synchronous ``/v1/*`` handlers, and the background scan-job pool in
``app/jobs.py``. Without synchronization the failure mode is not a crash but
a silently wrong chart for one of two concurrent requests — invisible, and
the worst possible defect for a determinism-first engine.

These tests pin the fix: a single process-wide re-entrant lock
(``bphs_core.utils.EPHEMERIS_LOCK``) that every C-library entry point holds
for the duration of its computation.
