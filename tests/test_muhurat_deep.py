"""Deep unit tests for bphs_core.muhurat.

These target the branches of ``compute_muhurat_for_day`` and its helpers that
the endpoint-level tests in ``test_coverage.py`` never reach:

  * the per-limb failure handlers — exercised by monkeypatching the relevant
    ``drik`` function to raise. Since the failure-mode decision of 2026-08-17
    these are no longer uniform: a limb that can change WHICH time is
    recommended raises ``MuhurtaLimbError``, and a supplementary limb degrades
    behind an explicit per-limb flag. The classification itself is pinned by
    tests/test_muhurat_limb_failure_modes.py; the tests here exercise the
    branches around it;
  * the personalised Tara-/Chandra-bala block, including both the "no natal
    Moon supplied" skip and the two failure fallbacks;
  * the ``get_karana_name`` fixed-karana table, the ``get_tithi_name`` Krishna
    branch, and the ``float_hours_to_hhmm`` minute-rounding carry;
  * the 30-muhurta limb, against the REAL ``drik.muhurthas`` — its wire shape,
    the served windows, and the two failure modes (environmental → visibly
    degraded; contract break → raises).

Monkeypatching ``drik`` is used to simulate FAILURE, never to invent a success
shape: a fabricated return validates the parser against a fiction. Where a test
needs real library output it calls the library, and ``TestMuhurthaLibraryShape``
pins that output positionally — both the per-entry shape and the ORDER of the 30
entries — so a dependency bump that moves either fails loudly here. The order is
load-bearing because the served label is assigned by index
(``_MUHURTA_NAMES[i]``) and the library's own name for slot ``i`` is discarded.

All ``drik`` monkeypatching targets ``bphs_core.muhurat.drik`` — the name the
module actually looks up at call time.

# The POSITIONAL signature of the 30-fold division, index by index:
#
#     (label this repo serves, the library's own key, the library's flag)
#
# Why this table exists. ``drik.muhurthas`` builds its list, in effect, as
# ``[(key, flag[key], slot[i]) for i, key in enumerate(const.muhurthas_of_the_day)]``
# — the time slots are derived from the index, the names come from the dict's
# insertion order. ``bphs_core.muhurat`` then discards ``entry[0]`` and labels
# slot *i* with ``_MUHURTA_NAMES[i]``. So the served label is only correct while
# the library's key order is exactly this one, and NOTHING in the served output
# reveals a drift: comparing the served labels to ``_MUHURTA_NAMES`` is
# tautological, because that is where they were copied from. Measured
# 2026-08-05: transposing the keys at index 1 and 2 of
# ``const.muhurthas_of_the_day`` served window 1 as "Ahi" where the library
# called it ``mithra`` and window 2 as "Mitra" where the library called it
# ``aahi``, with ``degraded: False`` — and the 82 tests then covering this limb
# (this file plus test_panchanga_fail_closed.py) all stayed green.
#
# This is the same defect class as the two planet-id spaces (repo CLAUDE.md,
# Engine conventions): positional identity carried across a library boundary.
#
# The library's own NAMES carry that identity, and the flags cannot carry it
# alone. Names are dict keys, so they are unique and EVERY transposition moves
# the sequence: 29/29 adjacent, 435/435 overall. The flag column takes only two
# values across the 30 positions, so most neighbouring pairs share one — and a
# transposition of two SAME-FLAG neighbours is invisible to it. That is the
# whole failure mode, and it costs the flag column most of its discrimination:
# 11 of the 29 adjacent transpositions (37.9%), 189 of the 435 (43.4%).
# Transposing index 1 and 2 happens to be caught (flags 0 and 1 differ), but
# transposing index 0 and 1 — ``rudra``/``aahi``, both flag 0 — is not, and it
# mislabels two windows just as thoroughly. The flag is kept as a SECOND,
# transliteration-independent signature: it is the one column that moves when a
# key holds its position while its auspiciousness value changes, which the name
# column cannot see.
#
# Every count in the paragraph above is COMPUTED from this table by
# ``TestSignatureColumnDiscrimination`` below and asserted there — cite what
# that test computes, and never re-count the table by hand into prose. A
# hand-counted run length stood in this very sentence, wrong, and was copied
# into CLAUDE.md and the change description before anyone re-derived it; three
# readers passed over it because re-reading a tally is not re-deriving it.
#
# Re-record only on a deliberate, reviewed dependency bump (pyjhora is pinned
# ``==4.8.7``), and re-derive the label correspondence when you do — a blind
# re-record would launder exactly the reorder this pins. Re-checked unchanged on
# the 4.8.6 -> 4.8.7 bump: that release revised the node retrogression and
# speed-info limbs, and left ``jhora.const.muhurthas_of_the_day`` untouched, so
# this table was verified rather than re-recorded.
