"""The lunar node model (Rahu / Ketu) is a DECLARED choice, not an inherited default.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
Rahu and Ketu can be computed from either the TRUE (osculating) lunar node — the
actual instantaneous intersection of the Moon's orbital plane with the ecliptic —
or the MEAN node, a smoothed analytical fit to that intersection. The two differ
by a lot. Measured in this repo with the frozen dependency set (pyswisseph
2.10.3.2, pyjhora 4.8.6) against the real Swiss ephemeris data files, scanning
1800-01-01..2400-12-31 (the engine's supported birth-date span, app/schemas.py)
one day at a time and refining the worst day at one-hour steps:

    max |true - mean| = 1.981465100 deg = 118.8879 arcmin = 7133.2744 arcsec
    at JD 2417129.4166666595 (1905-10-10 22:00 UT)

    over the same 219511 sampled days, the two models place Rahu in a
    different nakshatra PADA on 28.85% of them, a different NAKSHATRA on
    7.19%, and a different RASI on 3.20%

That is not a rounding difference; it is an interpretive difference, and it is
more than twice the ~0.883 deg Lahiri-vs-Fagan/Bradley ayanamsa error this repo
already treats as a serious defect.

Until this module existed the choice was pinned NOWHERE. The engine inherited
whatever the astronomy library defaulted to, and the dependency carried an open
lower bound (`pyjhora>=4.8.0`), so a routine version bump could have moved every
Rahu and Ketu by up to 1.98 deg with no code change at all. The committed goldens
would have caught the movement, but a golden failure with no declared model reads
as a regression to fix rather than a deliberate choice to honour — the right
answer existed nowhere, so the next reader would have guessed.

THREE LEVERS, AND THE OBVIOUS ONE IS NOT THE ONE THAT SERVES
------------------------------------------------------------
Measured while writing this, not read from documentation. `jhora.const._RAHU`
(and its `_use_true_nodes_for_rahu_ketu` flag) is the lever everything about the
library's naming suggests. Setting it to the mean node and computing a real
chart returns the TRUE node anyway, unchanged to the last digit: the chart path
is `charts.rasi_chart` -> `drik.dhasavarga(jd, place, 1)`, and dhasavarga
declares `set_rahu_ketu_as_true_nodes=True` as a LITERAL parameter default, so it
rebuilds the body table from that literal and never consults the constants.
`bphs_core.utils.apply_lunar_node_model` therefore pins the constants AND the
mutable `drik.planet_list`, and VERIFIES the serving literal it cannot set —
refusing to start if the library ever disagrees with the declaration.

THE CHOICE: TRUE NODE
---------------------
Recorded, with its rationale, in CLAUDE.md ("Engine conventions") and README.md.
In one line: every other graha this engine serves is a true/apparent position
from a modern ephemeris, so serving a smoothed mean element for one graha alone
would be internally inconsistent — and it is what the engine already served, so
declaring it changes no number anyone has already been given.

WHAT IS ASSERTED HERE
---------------------
The positive signal, never the absence of an error:

  * the declared model is TRUE, and all three levers really carry it;
  * a REAL served Chart's Rahu matches a direct TRUE-node computation and is
    ~1.98 deg away from the MEAN node (so this cannot pass on the wrong model);
  * Ketu is exactly Rahu + 180 deg;
  * the applier fails CLOSED when any lever will not honour the declaration —
    setter missing, setter ineffective, serving default flipped, serving
    parameter renamed away;
  * importing the package is what pins it, not luck about which module loaded
    first;
  * the dependency that supplies every one of those levers is pinned to an EXACT
    version in both pyproject.toml and uv.lock, so none of them can move
    underneath us.

Everything here is meaningful under BOTH runtimes — the Moshier fallback (the
ordinary CI job and the default local loop, no data files) and real Swiss data —
because the node model is a body-selection choice, not an ephemeris-source one.
Measured deltas of the served Rahu against a direct TRUE-node computation at the
worst epoch: 0.000000 arcsec on Moshier, 0.002977 arcsec on Swiss data.
