"""Fail-closed semantics for the panchanga pipeline.

Covers the direct longitude-based limb computation and every fail-closed path:
a tithi crash, a hard-gate (Rahu/Yama/Gulika) failure, eclipse/adhika-maasa
'could not be computed', the Amavasya naming + veto, and the
Unknown-vs-NoBirthData band/penalty split. The mandate for an electional engine
is that a missing limb means 'not recommendable / visibly degraded', never
'fine'.

Failure-mode decision, 2026-08-17 — this file is STRENGTHENED by it, not
weakened. The mandate above is unchanged; what changed is how loudly the
producer states it. A limb whose failure can change WHICH time is recommended
now RAISES ``MuhurtaLimbError`` instead of resolving to a degraded value:
the tithi/karana names, the three absolute vetoes (which used to set
``hard_gate_failed``), and the eclipse / adhika-maasa / panchaka flags (which
used to resolve to ``None``). An exception is the most visible form of 'not
recommendable' available, and it removes the reader's opportunity to
mis-handle a null. The consumer-side gates that read those values fail closed
exactly as before — ``_score_instant`` still hard-excludes on
``hard_gate_failed`` and on ``is_eclipse_day``/``is_adhik_maasa`` being
``None`` — and those gates are still asserted below, because a day payload
built by anything other than this producer can still carry them.

The per-limb classification for all of ``compute_muhurat_for_day`` is pinned by
tests/test_muhurat_limb_failure_modes.py.

Branch anchors below are named by function in bphs_core/lagna_shuddhi.py:

The ``# <symbol>: ...`` comments in this file are CITATIONS into that module,
resolved on every CI run by ``ci/tests/test_stable_anchor_citations.py``.  The
declaration line above is the Form B header lifted to module scope, which is
what gives a comment -- a construct with no enclosing AST scope to inherit an
owner from -- a machine-readable one.  A scope declares exactly ONE subject
module, so an anchor into any other (``bphs_core/muhurat.py``, for instance) is
spelled in full as ``<path>.py::<symbol>`` rather than as a bare comment opener,
and prose that is not a citation is not written in the ``Word: ...`` shape.

All ``drik`` monkeypatching targets ``bphs_core.muhurat.drik`` (for muhurat) or
``bphs_core.lagna_shuddhi.drik`` (for the scorer). Both attributes name the ONE
shared ``jhora.panchanga.drik`` module object, so a patch placed on it is also
seen by ``utils.graha_sidereal_longitude`` — the name -> body boundary the
per-graha longitude calls now route through.
