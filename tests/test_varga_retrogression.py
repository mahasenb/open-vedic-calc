"""Contract: retrogression belongs to the INSTANT, and it reaches every varga.

A graha's vakri state is decided by the direction it is moving at the moment the
chart is cast. A divisional chart re-maps longitude onto a finer grid; it does
not change the direction anything is moving. So the flag a varga serves must be
the flag the rasi chart serves -- for every graha, in every varga -- and it must
be the astronomically correct one. Extend this file, never weaken it.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS -- the coverage gap it closes, measured 2026-08-09 on the
then-frozen resolve (pyjhora 4.8.6 / pyswisseph 2.10.3.2; re-run unchanged on the
now-pinned 4.8.7) against the real Swiss data
files. Before this file, nothing in this suite observed a CLASSICAL graha's
``is_retrograde`` in ANY divisional chart. Sever the propagation at the varga
construction site -- replace ``computed=pid in retro_planets`` with
``computed=False`` in ``chart.py::_build_varga_chart``, so that every classical
graha is reported DIRECT in all ten vargas on every date -- and the whole suite
still passed, 741 tests, zero failures. The shadow grahas were already pinned in
every varga by tests/test_shadow_graha_retrogression.py, but
``utils.graha_is_retrograde`` returns True for Rahu and Ketu whatever
``computed`` says, so those assertions are blind to exactly that mutation. A
wrong vakri flag in a divisional chart moves cheshta bala, the dignity reading
and the karaka interpretation, and it was invisible.

WHAT WAS MEASURED ABOUT THE MECHANISM: the gap is PROPAGATION, not an
independent per-varga computation. ``chart.py`` calls
``drik.planets_in_retrograde`` exactly once and hands the same result to all ten
``_build_varga_chart`` calls, so a varga's flag is the rasi flag by construction
and there is exactly one link where it can be severed. Measured across eight
charts x eleven charts x seven classical grahas: zero varga/rasi disagreements.
Nothing about the served values was wrong; what was missing was anything that
would notice if they became wrong.

BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE PINNED, because only one of them can fail on its own:

* the POSITIVE control -- a graha genuinely retrograde at the instant reports
  retrograde in every varga;
* the NEGATIVE control -- the SAME graha, at a different instant where it is
  genuinely direct, reports NOT retrograde in every varga.

Every one of the five tara grahas appears retrograde in at least one fixture and
direct in at least one other, and ``test_the_fixture_table_observes_both_states``
asserts that property of the table itself -- a table that quietly degenerated
into all-direct would satisfy every other assertion here while proving nothing,
which is the precise defect being closed.

FIXTURE CHOICE -- margin from station. A graha within hours of stationing flips
on a hair's-breadth ephemeris difference, so every fixture below is far from
every station. Margins measured at hourly resolution at the fixture's own UT
instant (station = the nearest sign change of sidereal longitude speed):

    fixture       worst margin   graha         Sun/Moon
    1982-04-03    38.08 d        Jupiter       never station
    1948-06-23    11.83 d        Mercury       never station
    1977-07-03    50.33 d        Mercury       never station

11.83 d is close to the arithmetic maximum for Mercury, whose retrograde spell
lasts about 24 days. Margin in days understates the real safety factor; the
number that matters is how far the motion is from zero compared with how much
the two ephemeris runtimes disagree about it. Measured across all three
fixtures, the slowest graha of all (Saturn on 1982-04-03, 0.0765 deg/day) sits
3.2e5 times its own Swiss-vs-Moshier speed disagreement away from zero, and no
graha at any fixture is closer than 1.2e5 -- the sign cannot flip.

BOTH EPHEMERIS RUNTIMES. Every assertion here holds under the real Swiss data
files and under swisseph's built-in Moshier fallback -- verified 2026-08-09 by
running the served retrograde set of all eleven charts at all three fixtures
under each runtime and diffing: identical, every chart, every graha. That is a
requirement for anything in ``tests/`` (see CLAUDE.md); an instant whose answer
depends on the ephemeris source is a bad fixture, not a finding.

THE LUNAR NODES ARE NOT RE-DERIVED HERE. Rahu and Ketu are served retrograde by
DECLARATION (``utils.PERPETUALLY_RETROGRADE_GRAHAS``) because the true node's own
speed is positive about a quarter of the time and its sign near the turning
points differs between the two runtimes. This file takes that declaration as
given -- the expected sets below are built from it rather than restating it, so
there is one place the node reading lives, and tests/test_shadow_graha_retrogression.py
remains its tripwire.
