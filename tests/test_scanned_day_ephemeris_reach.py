"""A scanned day does not merely look up the day it was asked about.

``tests/test_date_field_ephemeris_range.py`` bounds every date field to the span
the shipped Swiss files cover for a POINT lookup. That is the right bound for
``birth_date`` and ``at_date``, which read the instant they name. It is not the
right bound for the three electional ``start_date``/``end_date`` pairs, because
``compute_muhurat_for_day`` reaches well outside the day it is scanning: the
lunar-month and yoga limbs search for events that are, by construction, not on
that day.

WHAT REACHES HOW FAR — MEASURED, per limb
-----------------------------------------
Each ``drik`` entry point ``compute_muhurat_for_day`` calls was driven over 702
probes (117 scanned days spanning three synodic months plus a spread across a
year, x 6 timezone corners), recording the furthest Julian Day its
``swe.calc_ut`` calls touch, as days from the scanned date's 00:00 UT::

    drik.lunar_month  (via _is_adhik_maasa)   +31.834 d      -2025.746 d
    drik.yogam                                +24.859 d          -0.083 d
    drik.nakshatra / varjyam / amrita_gadiya
      / panchaka_rahitha                       +2.543 d          -1.398 d
    drik.tithi / karana                        +1.998 d          -0.083 d

Re-measured at the LOW edge (scanned days 1800-01-02..1806-07-30, 8 timezone
corners), driving ``compute_muhurat_for_day`` whole, the forward ceiling is
unchanged: **+31.835 d**, at 1800-01-25 and again at 1804-02-11. The forward
reach is therefore a property of the lunar month, not of the era, which is what
makes one constant safe to derive from it.

TWO CORRECTIONS TO WHAT THIS REPO PREVIOUSLY RECORDED
-----------------------------------------------------
1. ``drik.tithi``'s next-day search was named as a primary cause of the
   end-of-range residual. Measured, it is the SMALLEST of the out-of-day
   reaches (+1.998 d). The limb that actually reaches furthest forward after
   ``lunar_month`` is ``drik.yogam``, at +24.859 d, which no note in this
   repository mentioned.
2. The earlier measurement used a spy declared ``def spy(jd, planet, flags,
   *a, **k)``. pyjhora calls ``swe.calc_ut(jd_utc, planet, flags=flags)`` by
   KEYWORD on the ``sidereal_longitude`` path, so that spy survives only because
   its third parameter happens to be spelled ``flags``; renaming it raises
   TypeError and the probe silently records nothing. The spy here takes
   ``*args, **kwargs`` and proves its own liveness against BOTH spellings before
   any count is read, because a zero has to mean absence and not a broken probe.

WHY THE REACH IS BOUNDED AND THE BOUND IS NOT ARBITRARY
-------------------------------------------------------
``_is_adhik_maasa`` asks whether the amanta month containing the scanned day is
intercalary, which requires the new moons bracketing it. The furthest of those
is at most one synodic month away (max ~29.83 d), plus the scanned day itself
and the timezone span (up to 0.583 d at tz=+14) — a ceiling near 31.4 d, against
the 31.835 d measured. The upper bound is set so that ceiling clears the end of
the data with margin, and the margin is asserted below rather than asserted to
exist.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT CLAIM
-------------------------------
The lower bound is NOT narrowed, and that is a measured decision rather than an
omission. ``drik.lunar_month`` also searches BACKWARD, to an anchor rather than
through a window: from 1800-01-02 it reaches -540.974 d, landing on 1798-07-10,
and the distance grows day by day because the anchor stays put. It resets
periodically — measured across 1800-01-02..1806-07-30 the backward reach is a
sawtooth with an amplitude up to -1605.399 d (at 1805-10-03) that falls back to
-17.475 d (at 1806-07-30). Bounding that away would cost roughly four and a half
years of the served range.

It is not narrowed because the measurement says it would buy nothing. The
question that decides it is not "does the search leave the files" — it does —
but "does the engine STAY on the fallback afterwards", as it does for a read past
the END of the files. Measured, it does not: after ``_is_adhik_maasa`` runs at
the extremes of that sawtooth, and after a FULL low-edge day compute, an in-span
lookup still answers from Swiss data. The stickiness ``_is_eclipse_day`` had to
restore around is not symmetric, so no restore was added and no bound was moved.
That asymmetry is asserted in ``tests/test_muhurat_edge_probe_engine.py``, not
here — it is the evidence for a decision NOT to change something, which is
exactly the kind of claim that has to stay falsifiable.
