"""FR-LOW-2 — birth_date must fall within the supported ephemeris range.

PersonalDataIn.birth_date / FamilyMember.birth_date previously accepted any
year 1-9999 and reached swe.julday() unguarded. An extreme year outside the
loaded ephemeris data's range is at best a 500 and possibly a native-level
fault -- confirmed locally: birth_date=9999-01-01 raises an uncaught
swisseph.Error deep in the pyjhora call chain rather than a clean validation
error.

Both PersonalDataIn (exercised via /v1/chart) and FamilyMember (exercised
via /v1/muhurat/family-lagna-shuddhi) share the same BoundedBirthDate
constraint (app/schemas.py), so an out-of-range date is rejected as a 422 at
the schema boundary before it ever reaches the ephemeris.

THE BOUND IS THE MEASURED ONE, NOT THE ADVERTISED ONE
-----------------------------------------------------
Upstream describes the shipped files as covering "AD 1800-2400", and this
guard used to take that literally: a YEAR bound of 1800..2400, which accepts
every date through 2400-12-31. The files do not go that far. Measured with
``bphs_core.utils.probe_ephemeris_source`` (the engine's own canonical
Swiss-vs-Moshier detector) at one-day steps, the last day the seven visible
grahas answer from ``sepl_18.se1``/``semo_18.se1`` is **2400-01-10**; on
2400-01-11 every one of them silently becomes Moshier.

Silently is the whole problem. swisseph substitutes its built-in analytical
ephemeris when the data runs out and still returns a full, plausible result,
so the tail did not error — it answered. Measured end-to-end on /v1/chart
before this bound was tightened, spying on every ``swe.calc_ut`` a served
request makes:

    2400-01-10  ->  HTTP 200, 15/15 calls on Swiss data
    2400-01-11  ->  HTTP 200, 12/15 calls on MOSHIER
    2400-06-01  ->  HTTP 200, 15/15 calls on MOSHIER
    2400-12-31  ->  HTTP 200, 15/15 calls on MOSHIER

355 days of advertised range answering on the fallback engine, at 200, with
nothing in the response saying so.

WHY THE BOUND KEEPS A DAY OF MARGIN AT EACH END
-----------------------------------------------
``timezone_offset_hours`` is bounded [-12, +14], so the UTC instant for a
given local DATE ranges from (D-1 10:00 UTC, at tz=+14 local 00:00) to
(D+1 11:59:59 UTC, at tz=-12 local 23:59:59). A date-only bound set exactly
at the file boundary therefore still admits legal requests that land past it
-- measured, 2400-01-10 23:59:59 at tz=-12 was 12/15 Moshier, and the OLD
lower bound was already leaking the same way (1800-01-01 00:00:00 at tz=+14
was 12/15 Moshier before this change). The bound is pulled in one day at each
end so that EVERY admissible (birth_time, timezone_offset_hours) combination
inside it is Swiss-backed. ``test_every_admissible_instant_at_the_bounds_is_
swiss_backed`` re-measures that property rather than restating the constants.
