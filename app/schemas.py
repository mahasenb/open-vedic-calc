# The supported birth-date span, MEASURED against the shipped Swiss Ephemeris
# data files rather than taken from the label on them.
#
# Upstream describes seas_18/semo_18/sepl_18 as covering "AD 1800-2400"
# (EPHEMERIS_LICENSE.md), and this bound used to be a YEAR range that took that
# literally: 1800..2400, i.e. everything through 2400-12-31. The files stop
# earlier. Measured with bphs_core.utils.probe_ephemeris_source() at one-day
# steps, the last day the seven visible grahas answer from the data files is
# 2400-01-10; on 2400-01-11 every one of them returns FLG_MOSEPH.
#
# That does not fail — it ANSWERS. swisseph silently substitutes its built-in
# Moshier analytical ephemeris when the data runs out and still returns a full,
# plausible result, so the whole tail of the advertised range was being served
# at HTTP 200 off the fallback engine with nothing saying so. Measured on
# /v1/chart, spying on every swe.calc_ut a served request makes: 2400-01-10 was
# 15/15 calls on Swiss data, 2400-01-11 was 12/15 on Moshier, and 2400-06-01
# through 2400-12-31 were 15/15 on Moshier. For a determinism-first engine that
# is the wrong thing to advertise, so the bound is the measured one.
#
# THE ONE-DAY MARGIN AT EACH END IS DELIBERATE. These bound a local DATE, while
# the ephemeris is queried at a UTC INSTANT, and timezone_offset_hours spans
# [-12, +14] — so a single local date covers UTC instants from (D-1 10:00) to
# (D+1 11:59:59). A date bound sitting exactly on the file boundary therefore
# still admits requests that land past it: measured, 2400-01-10 23:59:59 at
# tz=-12 was 12/15 Moshier, and the old lower bound leaked the same way
# (1800-01-01 00:00:00 at tz=+14 was 12/15 Moshier). Pulling in one day at each
# end makes every admissible (birth_time, timezone_offset_hours) combination
# inside the range Swiss-backed; tests/test_birth_date_ephemeris_range.py
# re-measures that property, and pins the file boundary as tight, on every run
# against real data.
#
# Outside this span a birth_date would otherwise reach swe.julday() unguarded
# downstream (bphs_core/chart.py, lagna_shuddhi.py, muhurat.py, transits.py) —
# at best an ephemeris result computed on the fallback and reported as if it
# were not, at worst a native-level fault in the single-worker container (year
# 9999 raises an uncaught swisseph.Error deep in the pyjhora call chain).
# Reject it at the schema boundary as a clean 422 instead.

# The SCANNED-DAY span: the same files, a different question asked of them.
#
# The span above is the right bound for a POINT lookup — birth_date and at_date
# read the instant they name, so a one-day margin for the timezone span is all
# they need. An electional scanned day is not a point lookup. Measured per limb
# over 702 probes (117 scanned days across three synodic months plus a spread
# over a year, x 6 timezone corners), recording how far each drik entry point
# compute_muhurat_for_day calls reaches from the scanned date's 00:00 UT:
#
#     drik.lunar_month (via _is_adhik_maasa)  +31.834 d   -2025.746 d
#     drik.yogam                              +24.859 d       -0.083 d
#     drik.nakshatra / varjyam / amrita_gadiya
#       / panchaka_rahitha                     +2.543 d       -1.398 d
#     drik.tithi / karana                      +1.998 d       -0.083 d
#
# Re-measured at the edges, driving compute_muhurat_for_day whole across 8
# timezone corners, the forward ceiling holds: +31.835 d over scanned days
# 1800-01-02..1806-07-30, and +31.815 d over 2398-12-01..2399-12-01. The forward
# reach is a property of the lunar month, not of the era.
#
# WHY THERE IS A CEILING AT ALL. _is_adhik_maasa asks whether the amanta month
# containing the scanned day is intercalary, which needs the new moons
# bracketing it; the furthest is at most one synodic month away (max ~29.83 d),
# plus the scanned day and the timezone span (up to 0.583 d at tz=+14).
#
# Those terms sum to ~31.4 d, which is BELOW the 31.835 d measured — so state
# plainly what the remaining ~0.4 d is, rather than quoting a "ceiling" a
# measurement already exceeds. It is SEARCH OVERSHOOT: pyjhora finds the new
# moon by iterating, and the iteration evaluates positions slightly PAST the
# instant it converges on, so the furthest Julian Day touched is a little beyond
# the event itself. The astronomy bounds the event; the solver adds a small,
# implementation-dependent tail on top of it.
#
# That is precisely why the served bound is set from the MEASURED reach with a
# margin, and not from the analytic sum: the analytic terms bound the event, and
# the thing that has to stay inside the files is the furthest READ. Treat ~31.4 d
# as the astronomical floor under the measurement, never as a proven ceiling over
# it — an independent re-measurement on a different sample returned +31.602 d for
# this limb, close to but not equal to the +31.834 d recorded here, which is
# exactly the kind of solver-dependent variation the 9.018 d margin absorbs.
#
# THE DERIVATION. The shipped Sun/Moon data was bisected against the files
# actually present: it answers from JD 2378496.4998 (1799-12-31 23:59 UT) to
# JD 2597651.3531 (2400-01-10 20:28 UT). A scanned day of 2399-12-01 has its
# 00:00 UT at JD 2597610.5, leaving a budget of 40.853 d before the data ends,
# against the 31.835 d worst measured reach — a margin of 9.018 d. The tight
# limit is 2399-12-10, whose budget clears the measured reach by 55 MINUTES;
# that is a coincidence, not a bound, so the served bound is not set there.
#
# WHAT THIS COSTS, STATED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED LATER: 39 days at the top of
# the range. A scan may no longer be requested for 2399-12-02..2400-01-09, which
# it could before — and which it answered at HTTP 200 with up to 303 of its
# ~2800 ephemeris calls taken from the Moshier fallback at Julian Days the
# shipped files DO cover, with nothing in the response saying so. Refusing a
# request the service was answering wrongly is the fix, not the regression.
#
# THE LOWER BOUND IS DELIBERATELY NOT NARROWED. drik.lunar_month also searches
# BACKWARD, to an anchor rather than through a window: from 1800-01-02 it
# reaches -540.974 d, landing on 1798-07-10, and the distance grows day by day
# while the anchor stays put, then resets. Measured across 1800-01-02..
# 1806-07-30 that backward reach is a sawtooth with an amplitude to -1605.399 d
# (1805-10-03) falling back to -17.475 d (1806-07-30). Bounding it away would
# cost roughly four and a half years of served range.
#
# It is not narrowed because the measurement says it would buy nothing. The
# question that decides it is not "does the search leave the files" (it does)
# but "does the engine STAY on the fallback afterwards", as it does for a read
# past the END of the files. Measured, it does not: after _is_adhik_maasa runs
# at 1800-01-02, 1800-07-21 and 1805-10-03 — the extremes of that sawtooth — an
# in-span lookup still answers from Swiss data, and so does one taken after a
# FULL low-edge day compute. The stickiness _is_eclipse_day had to restore
# around is not symmetric, so no restore was added here and no bound was moved.
# That asymmetry is the evidence for a decision NOT to change something, so it
# is pinned rather than left as a remark:
# tests/test_muhurat_edge_probe_engine.py::
#   test_adhik_maasa_probe_leaves_the_scanned_day_on_swiss_data.
# See also tests/test_scanned_day_ephemeris_reach.py.

# WHY the two spans need two REASONS, not just two pairs of dates. For a point

# the files cover a good deal more than MAX_SCANNED_DATE, and a caller told that
# 2399-12-15 is outside "the span the data files cover" would reasonably conclude
# the service was wrong, because the data for that day plainly exists. What is

# birth-relative MAX_DASHA_DAYS cap stays satisfied) to_date at 2400-01-09,
# 2450-01-01 and 2500-01-01 all served 200 with the swe.calc_ut count pinned at
# exactly 15, the natal chart, though the last runs ~100 years past the span.
# (A normal birth cannot show this: birth 1950-06-15 with to_date 2999-12-31 is
# refused 422 by the cap having made ZERO calls, so no such request is servable

# real and deliberate: a late-born chart can no longer request a dasha timeline
# past MAX_EPHEMERIS_DATE, which it could before (measured: birth 2390-06-15,
