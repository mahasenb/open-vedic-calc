    token. It strips before judging, so the verdict is a property of the value
    an operator meant to supply rather than of the padding it arrived with.

    Two rejections, both of them values that would boot green with the license
    obligation broken. **Blank** is the one this guard exists for: an
    unsubstituted template, a secret that resolved to nothing, or a dangling
    ``PUBLIC_SOURCE_URL=`` in an env file would otherwise serve

    the rest of the same class (``TODO``, ``changeme``, a bare ``owner/repo``
    slug, a filesystem path): a recipient cannot fetch any of them either.

    What this deliberately does NOT do is claim the URL *resolves*. There is no
    reachability probe and no scheme allowlist, because the 404-after-a-move
    failure that motivates the whole change is invisible to any local check --
    a validator implying otherwise would buy the appearance of the property

    422 (Unprocessable), not a 5xx, matches this service's existing convention:
    every "well-formed request the engine cannot fulfil" here (date-range caps,
    end-before-start, member counts, invalid activity) is already a 422, and a
    limb that cannot be computed for the requested date/place is the same class
    of outcome — deterministic, so retrying the identical request cannot change
    it. The failure is still logged server-side at ERROR with the originating
    traceback at the raise site (``muhurat._require``), so mapping it to 422
    loses no observability.

    Registered against the exception class, so it fires wherever a limb error
    reaches the request/response cycle (the ``/v1/muhurat`` sync route and the
    synchronous lagna-shuddhi routes alike). It does NOT fire on the async

# Intentionally unauthenticated: this is the container liveness probe. The
# docker-compose healthchecks and any orchestrator startup probe hit /healthz
# with no Authorization header, and the service runs on internal-only ingress.
# The body carries no sensitive data — only a status string and a boolean for
# whether the ephemeris data is genuinely in use.
#
# CALC-1: ``ephe_loaded`` used to be ``os.path.isdir(data/ephe)`` -- True for
# an EMPTY directory (exactly what `mkdir -p data/ephe` in the Dockerfile
# leaves behind before any volume mount), so this probe reported healthy the
# entire time every worker thread was silently computing on the Moshier
# fallback (see bphs_core/utils.py for the root cause). It now derives the
# signal from the same retflag evidence the accuracy gate uses --
# ``utils.probe_ephemeris_source()`` asks swisseph directly and reads the
# FLG_SWIEPH/FLG_MOSEPH bit, so a mounted-but-empty or otherwise unusable
# ephemeris directory reports False instead of a false "ok".
#
# ``status`` now FOLLOWS ``ephe_loaded`` instead of being the constant "ok".
# It was the constant, so this endpoint asserted health while every chart came
# from the fallback -- measured 2026-07-31 against the image digest the staging
# revision was serving: ``200 {"status":"ok","ephe_loaded":false}``. A probe
# that passes with the control off is not a probe.
#
# The HTTP status stays 200 deliberately, and the STATUS STRING carries the
# signal. ``app/ephemeris_guard.py`` refuses to start a real deployment on the
# fallback at all, so "degraded" is only ever reachable in
# development/local/test -- the environments that deliberately tolerate the
# fallback, where the suite itself runs. A 503 there would break the
# docker-compose healthcheck and the dev loop while buying no accuracy in any
# environment that serves anyone. tests/test_ephemeris_baked.py pins both halves.

# bearer-token-holding backend. The public AGPL source offer is the public
# GitHub repository, not this internal endpoint.
#
# ``ephe_loaded``/``ephemeris_source`` are carried HERE, not only on /healthz,
# because /healthz is not reachable through Cloud Run's frontend: it answers
# that path itself with a Google 404 that never reaches this container
# (measured 2026-07-31 -- /healthz returns Google's "Error 404 (Not Found)!!1"
# page while other unmatched paths return a different 404 body). A consumer
# that must FAIL A DEPLOY on this signal therefore has to read it from an
