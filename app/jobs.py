"""In-process async job store for the scan-class electional endpoints (CR-4).

The service runs as a single, GIL-bound worker; a wide date-range scan (up to
``MAX_LAGNA_SHUDDHI_DAYS`` days, both solo and multi-member) can occupy a
request's thread -- and the caller's open HTTP connection -- for the full
scan duration, which starves concurrent interactive chart requests behind
it and risks the caller's own connection/proxy timeout. This module gives
those scan endpoints an ADDITIVE async submit/poll variant: submit hands
back a job id immediately and the scan itself runs on a small dedicated
background thread pool, decoupled from the submitting request's lifecycle,
so the HTTP call that kicks it off returns right away.

This is intentionally the simplest mechanism available that needs no new
infrastructure: an in-memory dict guarded by a lock, plus a stdlib
``ThreadPoolExecutor``. No queue, no Redis, no second process. Job state is
process-local and does not survive a restart -- acceptable here because the
existing synchronous ``/v1/*`` endpoints remain fully intact as the
canonical, durable path; this store only backs the additive async variant.

FR-MED-21: ``submit()`` used to insert into ``self._jobs`` and nothing ever
removed an entry -- ``get()`` only reads. A long-lived container fielding a
steady trickle of scan submissions would grow the dict (and the completed
job's ``result``/``error`` payload it holds) without bound until the process
is OOM-killed. ``JobStore`` is now capped at ``max_jobs`` entries: each
``submit()`` prunes the oldest terminal (``done``/``error``) jobs first, and
falls back to dropping the oldest entry outright if the cap is still
exceeded (which only happens if more jobs are in flight than the cap allows,
an already-pathological case for a 4-worker pool). Both endpoints are
authenticated (trusted caller), so this is a memory-hygiene bound, not an
abuse control.

DESIGN NOTE: This module solves the caller-connection-timeout problem for
long-running scans but does NOT eliminate GIL contention between CPU-bound
scans and sync handlers. The full accepted trade-off rationale (what it solves,
residual contention behavior, why it is acceptable, and when the decision would
reverse) is recorded in CLAUDE.md → "Async scanning design".

    contention; a small bound simply lets a handful of scans queue and run
